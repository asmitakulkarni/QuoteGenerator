       "\"I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall. I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad. Hagrid is bringing him. Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life. No problems, I trust, Hagrid? The only family he has. Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready. There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all. Good luck...Harry Potter. I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you. Let the feast...begin. SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!  Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons. Back again, Harry?  I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is. Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers? What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs. Fine. They're both just fine. Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die. Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. Love, Harry, love.  Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee... Mm. Alas. Earwax. Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points.  Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points.  In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points.  And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House. Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award.  To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess  that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points.  And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom. Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order.  Gryffindor wins the House Cup! They are not. I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself.  However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action. Splendid.  Now, I suggest we return to the feast.  There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. Argus! Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three. She's not dead, Argus.  She's been Petrified. But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say. Innocent until proven guilty. We will be able to cure her, Argus.  As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes.  When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.  In the meantime, I advise caution. To all. There's been another attack. It means our students are in great danger, Minerva.  Mr. Creevey was fortunate.  If not for this... He would surely be dead. Tell them the truth.  Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.  Tell them it's as we feared.  The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again. About time too.  He's been looking dreadful for days.  Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day.  He's really very handsome most of the time. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. Hagrid -- Hagrid -- HAGRID!  I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone. No, Harry.  But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me.  Anything at all? It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom. I'm afraid they are, Tom. Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid. Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom? Very well then.  Hurry along. Good evening, Hagrid. I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence. And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius? Calm yourself, Hagrid! If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside.  However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me.  You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. Ingenious.  Simply... ingenious. Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.  I taught him myself fifty years ago.  After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped.  When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been. Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley.  No, I think you've endured enough.  I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however.  And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate.  I always find that cheers me up.  Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules? And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both? Therefore, it seems only fitting... That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup. Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.  We need our gamekeeper back. First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.  Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something.  Am I right? You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.  Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not intentionally, but... yes. It's true, Harry.  You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes.  Resourcefulness. Determination.  A certain disregard for the rules.  Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. Exactly.  Which makes you very different from Voldemort.  It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry.  It's our choices. If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this. Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat. Yes.  When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius. Oh yes.  It was Voldemort.  Only this time, he chose to act through someone else.  By means of... this. Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands.  The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe. Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified. Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled. Welcome!  Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!  I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast.  I myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair... Mm.  Yes.  First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Good luck to you, Professor. As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.  Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid! Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban. The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds.  While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities.  Under no circumstances are you to approach them.  It is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving. Mr. Filch.  Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady. Dear lady.  Who did this to you? Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.  The rest of you... to the Great Hall. I didn't really expect him to linger. I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped Sirius Black enter it, Severus. No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe.  And I'm more than willing to let the students return to their Houses.  But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep... It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest. Sir Cadogan.  Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor Tower tonight? Scabbers...? I do, Miss Granger.  But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others.  A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. Ah... a shooting star.  If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time.  But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem... Mysterious thing, time.  Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous.  Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen.  And you would, I feel, do well to return before this last chime.  If not... well, the consequences are really too ghastly to discuss.  Three turns should do it, I think.  If you succeed, more than one innocent life may be spared tonight. By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck. Excuse me, Minister.  I believe I must sign as well... Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster... How extraordinary! I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid.  How could you?  You've been with us all along. Search the skies if you must, Minister.  In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid.  Or... a large brandy. It seems your services will no longer be required. By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck. Well? Did what? Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen... So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime. And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff. Igor. Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them. Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch. My dear old friend, thanks for coming. Silence! The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun. Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection! The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum! The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory. Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup! Harry Potter. Harry Potter? Harry Potter! Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire? Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you? You're absolutely sure? That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty. What do you suggest Minerva? You heard Barty the rules are clear. I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you? Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate. What are you doing here Miss Granger? Barty. The bag. Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon... (VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant. (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own. (Continued) You may begin at the start of the cannon. (Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task. Harry! I want all the judges over here now. Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory! For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre. A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action. Then for once show them some. But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think. Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp. The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am. Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning. He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask? Have there been other dreams like this? I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply... Cast them away. Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory... (continued) and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum... (continued) The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round. (To the contestants) In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way. On the count of three... ONE... Harry! Harry! Tell me what happened! It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are. Severus... Do you know who I am? Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya? Is he in this room? Is he in this room? Harry get away from there! Are you alright Alastor? Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus. We'll get you up in a minute. Barty Crouch Junior. Your arm Harry. Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes. (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end. I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry. Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared. No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone. I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it... You’ve been reckless this summer, Harry. Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm. Do as I say. Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time. Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right? Wand out, Harry. Lumos... Horace! I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace. Dragon’s blood. Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One. So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you? Take matters into their own hands? Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you? Mind? That was fun.  May I use the loo? Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind. Indeed they are. You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return... I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl. You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. Both are waiting for you. The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn. Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape. Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why. Once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle’s corridors. Slept beneath its roof.  He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  His name? Tom Riddle. The Hall goes utterly silent. Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip! Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit. So.  How are you? Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you. Do you? And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction? I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can’t help but wonder if -- Forgive me, Harry, I... ... I was merely curious. In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here. What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle. This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I’d like you to see it.  If you would... I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth. Perhaps you could give me an example. How do you do, Tom. As you wish. No.  I am a Professor. Perhaps they’re right. Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. It’s a school.  A school of... magic. You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t. Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom. I’m like you, Tom.  Different. I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It. Take it out. Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? Why did you want these things, Tom? Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I’ll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully. It is unusual.  But not unheard of. Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I... Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be? No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything. I did. Yes. Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren’t. This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected.  It’s also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn. I suspect he is ashamed of it. Why indeed. I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so. Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  Any way you can. You’re the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind. Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail. Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace? Why indeed. This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison. To whom might I ask? Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended. How is he?  Horace? This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse. Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He’s just told us. They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book... It’s a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and... One destroys Voldemort. True.  But magic, especially Dark magic... ... leaves traces. Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone. Once again, I shall ask too much of you. Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There’s nothing more to discuss. Harry.  You need a shave, my friend. At times I forget how much you’ve grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man. Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. A trait people never fail to undervalue.  I’m afraid. The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question. Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide. Should I tell you to run, you will run. And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself... You will do so. Your word, Harry. Take my arm. Being me has its privileges. This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty... One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged. In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder. Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine. Careful.  The water. It’s there.  The only question is how do we get to it? Perhaps not. If you would, Harry... Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck. Yes. Remember... the water. Oh yes. It has to be drunk. You remember the condition on which I brought you with me? This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I’m here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood? Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry. Don’t... don’t make me... Nooooooo!!! Make it stop... Please... make it stop... My fault.  It’s all my fault... Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY! Your word, Harry!  Your word! Kill me!  It’s the only way! Water. Water... Aguamenti. Water! Go... We have to... go. I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you. No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened... Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here... No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate. Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what. Do as I say, Harry. Trust me. Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer? I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? You are not an assassin, Draco. Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I’m curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper? Then I shall make it easy for you. Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy. You’re not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How? That cabinet has been broken for years. Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin. A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco. Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time. Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order. Severus... Severus... please.\""
