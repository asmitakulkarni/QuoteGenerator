Can you...hear me?  It\\'s just...I\\'ve never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often?  You\\'re from Burma, aren\\'t you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family?  I see. That\\'s me as well. I never knew my parents, either. Anytime. Ow! I swear I don\\'t know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic! Hey, give it back! It\\'s mine! Because there\\'s no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir.  No sir, not one blasted, miserable--- Get off! Ahh! They\\'re my letters! Let go of me! Make a wish, Harry. Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads Excuse me, who are you? Sorry, no. Learnt what? I-I\\'m a what? A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I\\'d wager. Once you train up a little. No, you\\'ve made a mistake. I can\\'t be...a-a wizard. I mean, I\\'m just... Harry. Just Harry. Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\\' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry! You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me? Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash! Muggle? Okay. All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London? Oh, nice to meet you. Good-bye. But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am? But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven\\'t any money. Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things? What\\'s in there, Hagrid? I still need...a wand. Hello? Hello? Oh! Sorry, but what\\'s curious? And...who owned that wand? Wow. He killed my parents, didn\\'t he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do. Maybe if you wrote it down? Voldemort? Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me? What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who? Platform 9 3/4? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 3/4. There\\'s no such thing...is there? Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 3/4? Muggles? Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to No, not at all. I\\'m Harry. Harry Potter. The what? Oh, yeah. We\\'ll take the lot! Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavour Beans? These aren\\'t real chocolate frogs, are they? Hey, I got Dumbledore! Hey, he\\'s gone! Just a little bit. Yeah! Hey, Hagrid. I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks. Ahh! Nothing...it\\'s nothing, I\\'m fine. Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin. Wow. Say, Percy, who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? What\\'s he teach? I think she fancies you. We got lost. I don\\'t know, Sir. I don\\'t know, Sir. What\\'s Seamus trying to do to that glass of water? Can I borrow this?  Thanks. Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That\\'s odd. That\\'s the vault Hagrid and I went to. Whoa. Neville! Give it here, Malfoy. Give it here, Malfoy, or I\\'ll knock you off your broom! A century, according to McGonagall. But I\\'ve never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself? I-I didn\\'t know. Who doesn\\'t? What\\'s happening? Let\\'s go this way. Does anyone feel like...we shouldn\\'t be here? Let\\'s go. Run! It\\'s locked! And for good reason. Guarding something? I think so. What are those? I like this ball. What do I do with it? Whoa. I think we\\'re going to need another feather over here, Professor. I think she heard you. Where\\'s Hermione? How could a troll get in? Hermione! She doesn\\'t know! He\\'s going into the Girl\\'s Bathroom! Hermione, move! Whooa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa whoa! Do something! Anything! Hurry up! I don\\'t think so. Just knocked out.  Ew. Troll bogies. I\\'m not hungry. That explains the blood. Listen, last night, I\\'m guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that\\'s why he\\'s limping. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts\\' business, very secret. That\\'s what the dog\\'s guarding. That\\'s what Snape wants. But I-I never get mail. It\\'s a broomstick! But who...? A little bit. What happened? Yes!  Whoa! Yes! Whoa! Whooa! Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween? Yes? But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy\\'s guarding, Snape\\'s trying to steal it! Exactly. Nicholas Flamel? Nicholas Flamel...Who\\'s Nicholas Flamel? Knight to E-5. Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing? I\\'ve got presents? Oh! \"Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\" Some kind of...cloak. My body\\'s gone! I\\'m invisible?? There was no name. It just said, \"Use it well.\" Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you? Mum?  Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there. Ron! You\\'ve really got to see this! Ron! You\\'ve got to see this!  Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed! There\\'s something you\\'ve got to see. Now, come on! Come on. Come. Come look, it\\'s my parents! Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don\\'t you? Thats my dad How can it? Both my parents are dead. So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want? Shh! Hagrid! We think Snape\\'s trying to steal it. Hagrid, we know he\\'s after the Stone. We just don\\'t know why. What? Wait a minute.  One of the teachers? Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that? Norbert? Malfoy. Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him. I don\\'t understand. Is that bad? 50?! Hagrid, what\\'s that? If I didn\\'t know better, Draco, I\\'d say you were scared. What is it, Fang? But what was that thing you saved me from? But who would choose such a life? Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort? The Philosopher\\'s Stone. But he\\'s weak. He\\'s living off the unicorns. Don\\'t you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn\\'t want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He\\'ll He\\'ll come back. I think if he\\'d had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight. My scar. It keeps burning. Not like this. I think it\\'s a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh!  Oh. Of course! Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn\\'t I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  What did he look like? The stranger, though, you and he must have talked. And did he seem interested in Fluffy? We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately! He\\'s gone?! Now? But this is important! It\\'s about...the Philosopher\\'s Stone. Someone\\'s going to try and steal it. That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy. We go down the trapdoor. Tonight. Trevor. Now, Neville, listen. We were Let\\'s go.  Sorry. Snape\\'s already been here. He\\'s put a spell on the harp. We have to move its paw. Come on!  Okay. Push!  I\\'ll go first. Don\\'t follow until I give you a sign.  If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet? Jump! Go! Whoa!  Oh. Ahh! Hermione! Where are you?! Yeah, yeah, I\\'m fine. Apparently not. What? Ron, are you okay? Okay. Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. I don\\'t know. Sounds like wings. They\\'re not birds, they\\'re keys. And I\\'ll bet one of them fits that door. I don\\'t know. Strange. There! I see it!  The one with the broken wing! It\\'s too simple. Catch the key! Where are we? A graveyard. There\\'s the door. Wait a minute. No, Ron! No! He\\'s going to sacrifice himself! RON!  NO! Don\\'t move! Dont forget, we\\'re still playing.  Checkmate.  Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron\\'s right...I have to go on. Not as good as you. You?  No. It can\\'t be...Snape. He was the one B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me. Snape was trying to...save me? Th-then you let the troll in. I-I\\'m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I\\'ve won the house cup. Voldemort. Never! You liar! Ahhhhhhhhh! Admirers? Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione? But, what happened to the Stone? But Flamel, he\\'ll die, won\\'t he? How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next... Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back? What is it? All right there, Ron? All right. Hermione? Good job. One minute. Thanks, Hagrid. But Hagrid, we\\'re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. I\\'m not going home. Not really. I can\\'t, Hedwig.  I\\'m not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- Now you\\'ve done it. She\\'s bored.  If I could just let her out for an hour or two -- But I haven\\'t gotten any messages. From any of my friends.  Not one. All summer. I\\'ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don\\'t exist. What... Who are you? I see.  Not to be rude or anything, but this isn\\'t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom. Why don\\'t you sit down? Shhhh!  I\\'m sorry.  I didn\\'t mean to offend you or anything -- You can\\'t have met many decent wizards then. Are you... all right? Your... family? Not go back?  But... I have to. What terrible things?  Who\\'s plotting them? Okay!  I understand.  You can\\'t say -- Stop!  Stop! See why I\\'ve got to go back?  I don\\'t belong here.  I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts.  It\\'s the only place I\\'ve got... friends. Well, I expect they\\'ve been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven\\'t been writing me? Give me those.  Now. Dobby... Please... No... I can\\'t.  Hogwarts is my home. \\'Dear Mr. Potter.  We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening.  As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school.\\' Well done, Dudley.  Finally learned the days of the week, have you. It\\'s no good turning your beak up. It\\'s all we\\'ve got. Ron? Fred?  George?  What\\'re you doing here? Hedwig! I think it\\'s... brilliant! Raids? The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...? Harry, sir.  Harry Potter. Diagon Alley! Floo Powder? D-Dia-gon Alley! I\\'m fine, thanks.  I\\'m just -- Hagrid! I was lost, I -- Hang on.  What were you doing down there? I need to remember that one. Who? Thank you. You have these.  I\\'ll buy my own!-- He was a murderer. His name is Voldemort. Sorry.  Lost control of the trolley. I dunno.  The gateway\\'s sealed itself for some reason. The train leaves at exactly eleven o\\'clock.  We\\'ve missed it. Can\\'t hear a thing. Maybe we should go wait by the car. This is mad.  We can\\'t drive to Hogwarts. You don\\'t mean -- Ron, no. Something tells me we\\'re going to regret this. No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this. Uh, Ron.  I should tell you.  Most Muggles aren\\'t accustomed to seeing a flying car. There!  Up ahead!  Look... Do you hear that? Aaaahhhhh! I\\'m trying!  Your hand\\'s all sweaty! I think we found the train. Just out of interest, Ron.  Have you ever landed a car before? Up!  Up! Mind that tree! Turn!  Turn! Be thankful it\\'s not your neck. Aaaaahhhhh! Reverse!  Reverse! A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can\\'t get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn\\'t want me here this year. Professor Dumbledore.  Professor McGonagall... Mr. Filch.  You dropped this... You\\'re doomed. Hello, Colin.  Nice to meet -- Look at it this way.  How much worse can things get? \\'What is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s favorite color?\\' \\'When is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s birthday and what would his ideal gift be?\\' Hands on?  Hermione, he didn\\'t have a clue what he was doing. Draco? Get out of the way, Colin! Let\\'s take him to Hagrid.  He\\'ll know what to do. Malfoy.  He called Hermione, well, I don\\'t know exactly what it means... That\\'s horrible. What? No... not you, that... voice. That... voice.  Didn\\'t you hear it? Spooky. Did you hear it? That... voice. I heard it first in Lockhart\\'s office and then again, just -- It\\'s moving.  I think it\\'s going to... kill. That\\'s Filch\\'s cat.  Mrs. Norris. It\\'s not true, sir!  I swear!  I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don\\'t even know what a Squib is. When I said I wasn\\'t hungry.  We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris. Yes. He said he didn\\'t. You do believe me, don\\'t you? I can\\'t explain it -- it was... scary. D\\'you think I should\\'ve told them! -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean. But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it\\'s really been opened, that means... Maybe Ron\\'s right, Hermione.  I mean, look at his family.  The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries. How long will it take to make? A month?  But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then. No... no... not you. Dobby! It was you!  You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through! You nearly got Ron and me expelled! Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? You\\'d better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you! I don\\'t suppose you could tell me why you\\'re trying to kill me? Why do you wear that thing, Dobby? Repeat itself?  You mean, this has happened before? Tell me, Dobby?  When did this happen before?  Who\\'s doing it now? No, Dobby!  Tell me!  Who is it? Nice to meet you.  I\\'m -- I wouldn\\'t bet on that. Who cares? You wish. Rictusempra! Leave him! Leave him! I\\'m a what? I know.  I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.  But so what?  I bet loads of people here can do it. What\\'s bad?  If I hadn\\'t told that snake not to attack Justin -- You were there!  You heard me! I spoke a different language?  But I didn\\'t realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can? But I\\'m not.  I... can\\'t be. Who am I, Hedwig?  What am I? Hagrid... what\\'re you doing here? It\\'s nothing.  I\\'d better get going.  I\\'ve got a lot of studying... Professor, I swear I didn’t -- Well, you see, I was wondering... You\\'re wrong! Professor, your bird... I couldn\\'t do anything... He just caught fire. You don\\'t think it was me, Professor? No, Professor.  Nothing. He\\'s the only one. Maybe they\\'re right. I didn\\'t know I could speak Parseltongue.  What else don\\'t I know about myself?  Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it. Crabbe and Goyle. Ron? We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. Lower. Less intelligent. Excellent. Hermione, are you okay? You\\'re wrong! Harry Potter. Then you must have some idea who\\'s behind it all? Hermione, come out.  We\\'ve got loads to tell you! Nothing. Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday.  I suppose that\\'s something. Looks like Myrtle\\'s flooded the bathroom. Why would I throw something at you? Who threw it at you anyway? This is a diary.  And it\\'s old... I\\'ll take my chances... Ahhh!  MY EYES!  MY EYES! Ginny!  I was only joking -- Brilliant.  Even your sister thinks I\\'m the monster now. That\\'s odd.  He never wrote in it. Special Services to the School or something -- Yes.  Why? Fifty years ago!  That means -- That\\'s a brilliant theory, Hermione.  With just one tiny little flaw.  There\\'s nothing written in this diary. You don\\'t think I\\'m dangerous, do you, Hermione?  I mean, you\\'re not scared.  Of me. Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets? Can... you... tell... me? Excuse me.  Could you tell me where I am?  Hello...? Ron!  Ron! It was Hagrid.  Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. The monster had killed someone, Ron.  What would any of us done? What\\'s that you\\'ve got, Hagrid? And they found it... Tom Riddle\\'s diary is gone. What do you understand! The library? We\\'ve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can\\'t believe it\\'s him.  But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he\\'ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets.  And that\\'s a start. I think it\\'s time to get my Dad\\'s old Cloak out again. What\\'s that for? Are you okay?  Hagrid?  Did you hear about Hermione? Look... we have to ask you something.  Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets? Look... C\\'mon. You heard Hagrid.  Follow the spiders. There\\'s something moving over there... something big. It\\'s been here all the time!  Look at it.  The Forest has turned it wild. C\\'mon, we don\\'t want to lose the trail. Don\\'t panic. Yes.  We\\'re friends of Hagrid\\'s. And you... you\\'re... ... Aragog, aren\\'t you? He\\'s in trouble.  Up at school, there\\'ve been attacks.  They think it\\'s Hagrid.  They think he\\'s opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. But if Hagrid never... that means... you\\'re not the monster. Shhh! But if you\\'re not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago? But have you seen it? What! Well... thank you.  We\\'ll just go... Let\\'s go! The windows! Roll up the windows! Don\\'t mention it. That way!  It\\'s the only way out! Hurry!  They\\'re catching up! Can you get us in the air? We know one thing.  Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.  He was innocent. Wish you were here, Hermione.  We need you.  Now more than ever... \\'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk.  Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent\\'s eye.  Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.\\' Ron!  This is it!  The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk.  That\\'s why I can hear it speak.  It\\'s a snake. Because no one did look it in the eye.  Not directly at least... Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must\\'ve seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!  Nick got the full blast of it, but he\\'s a ghost -- he couldn\\'t die again... ... And Hermione... had the mirror!  I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along. The water... there was water on the floor that night.  She only saw the Basilisk\\'s reflection... The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it!  That\\'s why Hagrid\\'s roosters were killed!  Spiders flee before it!  It all fits! Hermione answered that too. Remember what Aragog said?  About that girl fifty years ago?  She died in a bathroom.  What if she never left. C\\'mon.  Let\\'s go see Lockhart.  He may be a brainless git, but he\\'s going to try and get into the Chamber.  We can tell him what we know... We\\'ll find her, Ron.  Ginny\\'s going to be fine. Professor, we\\'ve got some information for you -- Are you going somewhere? You\\'re running away?  After all that stuff you did in your books? You wrote them! You\\'re a fraud!  You\\'ve just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done! Expelliarmus! Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor. To ask you how you died. Who was it, Myrtle? Just like that?  How? This is it, Ron.  This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. Open up. Oh, yes there is.  You first. All right.  Let\\'s go. Thanks, Myrtle. Lumos! Remember.  Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. Maybe it\\'s asleep. Ron?  Are you okay? Wait here.  I\\'ll go on.  I\\'ll go on and... find Ginny.  If I\\'m not back in an hour... See you in a bit. Open. Ginny!  Please don\\'t be dead. Ginny!  Wake up!  Wake up! Tom... Tom Riddle?  What d\\'you mean, she won\\'t wake?  She\\'s not... Are you a ghost? She\\'s cold as ice.  You\\'ve got to help me, Tom.  There\\'s a basilisk -- Give me my wand, Tom. Listen, we\\'ve got to go!  We\\'ve got to save her! But she\\'s dying! No... she couldn\\'t -- she wouldn\\'t. But... Why?... And why did you want to meet me? Hagrid\\'s my friend.  And you framed him, didn\\'t you? I\\'ll bet Dumbledore saw right through you. Well, you haven\\'t finished it this time.  In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again. Ginny stole the diary from my room?  But why? Like what? Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. You.  You\\'re the heir of Slytherin.  You\\'re Voldemort? Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world! He\\'ll never be gone!  Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes. Don\\'t look.  Don\\'t look into its eyes. Ginny.  You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You\\'ll find Ron... You were brilliant, Fawkes.  I just... wasn\\'t quick enough. Of course.  Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. It\\'s all right, Ginny.  It\\'s over. It\\'s just a memory... Where\\'s Lockhart? I think... I think he\\'s telling me he can take us out of here. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. It\\'s just, you see, sir, I couldn\\'t help noticing certain things.  Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me. Voldemort put a bit of himself in me? So the Sorting Hat was right.  I should be a Slytherin. Only because I asked it to. \\'Godric Gryffindor.\\' Dobby!  This is your Master?  The family you serve is the Malfoys! Sir?  I wonder if I could have that. Mr. Malfoy!  I have something of yours. I think you do, sir.  I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley\\'s cauldron that day in Diagon Alley. Just promise me something. Never try to save my life again. With loads of help from you. Lumos Maxima... Lumos Maxima... Lumos... MAXIMA! Uncle Vernon.  I need you to sign this form. Nothing.  Something for school... I will if she does. Yes. Oh, yes.  I\\'ve been beaten loads of times. That\\'s a lie. My dad wasn\\'t a drunk. Shut up!  Shut up! No!  She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me. Anywhere\\'s better than here. Aaaah! Fell over. I didn\\'t do it on purpose. I didn\\'t. The Leaky Cauldron.  That\\'s in London -- Isn\\'t this a bit... dangerous? Who is that?  That man. How\\'d he escape? Yeah.  Him I\\'ve heard of. This bus.  Don\\'t the Muggles ever... Hedwig! No thank you.  Minister... I don\\'t understand.  I broke the law. Underage wizards aren\\'t allowed to use magic at home -- \\'The state of things\\' sir? Sirius Black, you mean.  But... what\\'s that got to do with me? Egypt!  What\\'s it like? Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley. Of course, Mr. Weasley. Has this anything to do with him, sir? That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone... Voldemort...? Voldemort...? I know, sorry.  Ron hates it too. Kill me? Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? I didn\\'t mean to blow her up.  I just... lost control. Hi, Neville. Is he really asleep? Close the door. Yes. Dunno... Maybe we\\'ve broken down? Thanks. What was that -- that thing? What happened to me? And did either of you?  You know... pass out? But someone was screaming.  A woman. Fortuna Major. Yeah... Listen, you stupid prat -- Excuse me? Brilliant... Professor. At least Hagrid didn\\'t get sacked. Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go -- Really? Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain. Professor, can I ask you something? I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors... Before I fainted... I heard something.  A woman.  Screaming. I think it was my mother.  The night she was murdered. Sirius Black\\'s trying to kill me. Excuse me, sir, but... where\\'s Professor Lupin? Come on!  Faster! Probably a right sight better than he normally does. Brilliant. What happened? Really?  I meant the match.  Who won? Why do they affect me so, Professor?  I mean, more than everyone else... I\\'m scared, Professor. I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that Dementor on the train go away... But you made it go away. What\\'s this rubbish? \\'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder\\'s Map\\'...? Hang on.  This is Hogwarts!  And that... No.  Is that really... You mean, this map shows... Everyone? Brilliant!  Where\\'d you get it? The One-Eyed... Dissendium? Mischief managed. Shhh. He was their friend.  And he betrayed them.  He was their friend. I hope he finds me.  But when he does, I\\'m going to be ready.  When he does, I\\'m going to kill him. If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too. Expecto Patronum... Expecto... Patronum... Expecto... Expecto... That\\'s one nasty Dementor. The first time I rode a broom. There\\'s another.  It\\'s not happy exactly.  I mean, it is.  It\\'s the happiest I\\'ve ever felt.  But it\\'s... complicated. Expecto Patronum! I think I\\'ve had enough.  For today. I was thinking of him.  And Mum. Seeing their faces.  They\\'re just talking to me.  Just... talking. That was the memory I chose.  I don\\'t even know if it\\'s real... But it\\'s the best I have. Everybody out! Show yourself. Ron!  Ron! I could\\'ve killed him. I could\\'ve killed him. No, I won\\'t.  Know why?  Because I don\\'t care about your stupid rat! I don\\'t care about your stupid cat!  I\\'ve got few other things on my mind right now! I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Mischief managed! I was... I was... sleepwalking... My dad didn’t strut.  Nor do I. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'d appreciate you lowering your wand. Spare bit of parchment... \\'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...\\' \\'... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people\\'s business.\\' Professor.  Just so you know, I don\\'t think the map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.  Someone I know to be dead. Peter Pettigrew. Professor Trelawney -- S-sorry? No.  Nothing. It just got worse. I say we set him free. Ow! Hagrid... C\\'mon. What? That\\'s not good. Ron!  Run! Hold on, Ron! No, Ron... Nooooo!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don\\'t mention it.  Lumos. I have a hunch.  I just hope I\\'m wrong... Nox. The dog -- where\\'s the -- Then it\\'ll be you! Yes. No! You betrayed my parents!  You sold them to Voldemort! Did he listen!  When my mother was dying!  Did he hear her screaming! What\\'re you talking about? There\\'s nobody here. Expelliarmus! You said Peter before.  Peter who? No.  Pettigrew\\'s dead.  He killed him. The Map was lying then -- All they could find of Pettigrew was his\\xa0-- Show me. No. I know what he is.  But we\\'ll take him to the castle. Get off!  I said we\\'d take you to the castle.  After that, the Dementors can have you. I don\\'t reckon my father\\'d want his best friends to become killers for a worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew.  Besides:  Dead, the truth dies with him.  Alive... you\\'re free. I know. Come live with you?  When! No! Expelliarmus! Sirius! No!!! Please, Professor.  Stop... It\\'s me. Sirius! Sirius! No... No! Expecto... Patronum! Expecto... Patronum... I saw my dad. He sent the Dementors away... I saw him.  Across the lake... The Kiss...? You mean, they\\'re going to kill Sirius? It\\'s true, sir.  Sirius is innocent -- What just happened?  Where\\'s Ron? Huh?  Dunno... going to Hagrid\\'s? Hermione!  Will you please tell me what it is we\\'re doing?! But that... that\\'s... us.  This is not... normal. You mean, we\\'ve gone back in time? Good punch. Look.  Buckbeak\\'s still alive. Buckbeak?  But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius? What? Here they come.  I better hurry. That\\'s Pettigrew -- Hermione, that\\'s the man who betrayed my parents!  You don\\'t expect me to just sit here... Are you mad? That hurt. Shhh! Get away! C\\'mon, Buckbeak.  Come on... Now what? And we do that... how? Wait until Fred and George hear about that one. Here comes Snape. Now we wait. Hermione... Before.  Down by the lake.  When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away... It was my Dad. It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus. Dead.  I know.  I\\'m just telling you what I saw. You see Sirius talking to me? He\\'s asking me to come live with him. When we free him, I\\'ll never have to go back to the Dursley\\'s.  I\\'m going to tell him I\\'d like to live someplace in the country.  I think he\\'d like that, after all those years in Azkaban.  We don\\'t need a big place and I can help him... Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night.  While we just stand here... What are you doing? Thanks.  But we have to move. Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way. Let\\'s go. Don\\'t worry.  My Dad will come... Right there... you\\'ll see... he\\'ll come... any minute... he\\'ll conjure the Patronus He will!  He will come! Expecto Patronum! You were right, Hermione.  It wasn\\'t my dad I saw earlier.  It was... me.  I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.  I knew I could do it this time, because... because I\\'d already done it.  Does that make sense? I want to go with you. Anything. He\\'s free -- Sirius.  We... we did it. Afraid so.  Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has. You\\'ve been sacked. Resigned!  But why! Snape. But Dumbledore -- Well.  At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it was -- Yes. Whose is that? But... how?  Who? That\\'s a Hippogriff feather -- I don\\'t think it works.  I think it\\'s defective. Oh, come on now.  It\\'s just a broom. Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here? Last night. Where are we actually going? Yes sir. This way. Pleasure to meet you too sir. Why are they all standing around that manky old boot? What\\'s a \\'portkey\\'? Thanks. See ya later Cedric. (Smiling) I love magic. What is THAT? Crime? What crime? Those people tonight, in the masks... they\\'re his too aren\\'t they? they\\'re his followers. There was a man. Before. There. I dunno. I didn\\'t see his face. It\\'s alright I\\'ll get it. Oh no thank you I\\'m not hungry. I\\'m fine. Well there\\'s something you don\\'t see every day. I don\\'t know but I don\\'t think it\\'s Pumpkin Juice. Yeah well rather you than me. No sir. No sir. Yes sir. Let you know what? I didn\\'t ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You\\'re being stupid. I didn\\'t put my name in that cup. I don\\'t WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don\\'t know what happened tonight and I don\\'t know why, it just did ok. It\\'s a broomcupboard. Oh, no. I\\'m fourteen. I dunno I haven\\'t really thought about it. Fourteen. No I didn\\'t enter. (looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes aren\\'t glistening with the ghosts of my past. AGH! Sirius? Sirius?! How... No! I dunno. No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important. He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right? What are you saying? Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet? I\\'m not ready for this Sirius. Someone\\'s coming! Who says I was talking to anyone. Maybe you\\'re imagining things, wouldn\\'t be the first time. Neville! You\\'re doing it again! (reading a book) Magical water plants of the highland Lochs? Is that right? Well.... what? Well you can tell Ronald... Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going? What\\'s with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair? Dragons? That\\'s the first task? You\\'re joking. Ron was here? No he didn\\'t. He didn\\'t tell me a thing. Thanks. Excuse me.. (to Cedric) Can I have a word? Dragons. That\\'s the first task. They\\'ve got one for each of us. Yes. Don\\'t worry about it. (To Ron) You\\'re a right foul git you know that? I know so. Yeah. Stay away from me. I don\\'t give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He\\'s vile and cruel, and you\\'re just pathetic. Oh... um... You know I just thought I\\'d... Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I\\'m a fair flyer. But I\\'m not allowed a broom. Yeah. Battle a dragon. The horntail... Nothing. Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it? What the bloody hell was that? Caught on have you. Took you long enough. Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. Hagrid warned me about the dragons. Who could possibly figure that out? That\\'s completely mental. Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet? (To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you? Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them... I think I\\'d take the dragon right now. But then again he can take himself. Agreed. Cho! Ok thanks. Cho? Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me? Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good. What happened to you? What did she say? Don\\'t be silly. What did you do then? Hey! My dress robes. Well I expect yours are more traditional. Leave it alone. Who? Because we\\'d take the mickey out of her if she did. Ready professor? No. Yeah she does. What? Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor\\'s already figured it out. What\\'s that supposed to mean? Cedric. Spectacular. Forget about it. I\\'m sure you would have done the same for me. I must be out of my mind. Myrtle! Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water? Myrtle, there aren\\'t Merpeople in the black lake are there? Come seek us where our voices sound. An hour long you\\'ll have to look. Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione? Neville. No offense, but I really don\\'t care about plants. Now if there\\'s a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great. You\\'re sure about this Neville. For an hour. Most likely? You\\'re telling me this now? You must be joking. Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? Do I? But she\\'s my friend too! Hermione I finished last Hermione. Mr Crouch? I can come back later Professor. Agh! Professor? Sir, Mr Crouch\\'s son, what happened to him? It\\'s just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn\\'t quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch\\'s son. Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don\\'t think it\\'s actually happening do you? Yes sir. Bubble juice sir? I haven\\'t stolen anything. Fleur? Fleur! No stop! He\\'s bewitched Cedric. He\\'s bewitched! For a moment so did I. Some game. Together, on three. One, two, three! Yeah, you? I\\'ve been here before. I\\'ve been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now! Get back to the cup! Cedric! Don\\'t touch him. Have it your way. He\\'s back, he\\'s back! Voldemort\\'s back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn\\'t leave him, not there. Not so much now. The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it. Who? I dunno. It was like I\\'d fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. Um. I don\\'t think I said anything about a graveyard Professor. It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But... That\\'s Moody, but then who\\'s...? Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort\\'s wand and mine sort of connected. No I don\\'t think so. Yes. Yeah. Every week. Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser. Really. Hey.  I was wondering... I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things. I just Apparated, didn’t I? Can’t imagine why... After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir. My mother’s eyes, yeah. One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She’s the best in our year. Sir, exactly what was that all -- It’s alright, sir.  I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse -- But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there’s my trunk -- Sir? Really. Didn’t know. Dumbledore. When’d you get here? Oh come on... But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer? Rubbish.  He’s only -- what? Amazing. Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder? Reckon he’s right... Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which... Dunno.  Let’s get closer. I don’t know.  I’m turned around. What just happened? Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation. It’s happened.  He’s one of them. So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s?  Browsing for furniture? Look.  His father’s a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes. I need some air. Luna.  How’d you...? Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna. I am your friend, Luna. Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years. Have you ever fixed one?  A nose. What the hell.  Give it a go. Well?  How do I look? Brilliant. Later.  What’ve I missed? Thanks... This can’t be good. Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor -- It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my Really?  Well... brilliant.  I’ll head there straight away. Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron.  You see -- Crush it.  Don’t cut it. No.  Really -- Fine, sir. I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Definitely. Sir? No!  I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends.  But... no. Did you know, sir?  Then? You didn’t bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir? You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me. Do you want me to let him? All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me... Thanks.  All right.  This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear? All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It’s down to you two for Keeper.  We’ll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you’ll take on Ron. Quiet!  I’m Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three! C’mon, Ron... Ever heard of this spell? No. It’s... old.  The binding is fragile. I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it. The library. And? Good.  That settles it then. Who’s up for a Butterbeer? No.  Over here. No, no.  Sit next to me. Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you. So what brings you here, sir? I’d consider it an honor, sir. Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him. Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask. There’s no time! She was cursed, wasn’t she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn’t doing it knowingly. It was Malfoy. I... just... know. What does she see in him? You called him a slick git not five hours ago. I suppose. I don’t know.  She’s smart. Funny.  Attractive... You know.  She’s... got nice skin. Well, no.  I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor. I’ve never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice. I think I’ll be going to sleep now. What? Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass. I think I’ll be going. The shelf, sir? I don’t really know how to answer that, sir. Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? You knew him, didn’t you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher. What was he like? I’m sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see... Have it your way.  Juice? Dunno what you’re talking about. Yep.  Apparently it’s his lucky day. Yeah.  I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm? Ah.  Well... they’re really good. It feels like this. Have you? I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together.  As friends. So who are you taking? Really...? But I am the Chosen One. Okay.  Kidding.  I’ll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool. Neville...? What’re you doing? And what’s happened to you? Cormac!  That’s who you invited! I think she went to powder her nose. Dragon balls. I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date... A message...? Traveling?  Where? Positive.  Why? I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. Lovely. I’ll take your word for it. So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow? Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help. I know it sounds mad -- That’s not what it sounded like. But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself -- I’m not -- It’s good. Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? Did you get my owl? Go on. A Vanishing Cabinet? What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes? Soon. I know who I am, Hermione, alright? If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet. You tell me. Who could tell the difference? I don’t understand -- what happened? But why would he tamper with his own memory? Why? I don’t know him that well, sir -- Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something. Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic... I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach? Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he’s not like you.  He might... misunderstand. Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions. Sir -- Nice. Hermione.  I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle. I’ve seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map. The Map is never wrong. Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we? Or twenty. Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you. Excuse me? Well... Brilliant. Bloody well hope so.  She’s been snogging you for three months. Who’re you talking about? Okay.  Very funny. What the hell was that for? Okay!  Fine!  You’re in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her! Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- C’mon.  I’m going to introduce you to Romilda Vane. Devastatingly handsome. Sir.  I’m sorry.  I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely -- I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir. I’m sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding. I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort. Yes, sir.  It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible. Love potion. Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him! Professor!  Do something!! He’s choking!! Breathe!  C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE! How are you, Katie? Sectumsempra! The Room of Requirement... Who showed you this?  First. What? Oh.  Yeah. Say that again. Excellent.  Really excellent. Right.  I’m going down to Hagrid’s. No.  I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.  I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, know what I mean? Trust me.  I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does. Sorry, sir.  I should’ve announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout. Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t they? Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out. Through the front doors, sir.  I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see.  He’s a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don’t mind, I’ll be going. Sir? Well, then by all means come along, sir. That would be counterproductive, sir. No idea. A dead one, I think, sir. Not to mention the pincers. Through the front doors. Oh yeah. Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this. Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. I’m not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I’m not afraid of him.  And you shouldn’t be either. She didn’t just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep. Professor.  I’m going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It’s true.  I am the Chosen One. Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him. Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever. Sir -- Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux? Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly? Tom Riddle’s diary -- And the ring...? ... even more difficult to destroy. But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux... But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t they... It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir?  When you leave the school. Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable? It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map. He was going to the Room of Requirement. But I’m telling you.  I saw it -- What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets. I don’t know... I don’t need luck.  I’ll be with Dumbledore. You look the same to me, sir. Yes, sir. My word. Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts. It’s there, isn’t it? Sir! You should’ve let me, sir. We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir? Accio Horcrux! Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis? Professor... there are bodies in this lake. Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? Why can’t I drink it, sir? Professor? Professor?  Can you hear me? You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember. It will, sir.  It’ll stop.  But only if you drink... What? No... One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you say. I promise. You did it, sir.  Look -- I’m trying, sir.  I’m -- Don’t worry, sir.  We’re nearly there. We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey -- All right.  Okay. Sir, are you... praying? Cruciatus! Incacerata! Impedimenta! Fight!  Fight back, you coward! Sectumsempra! Hagrid... HAGRID! Hagrid!  You alright? Hagrid, Dumbledore -- Do you think he would’ve done it. Draco? No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing... Yeah, strange.  Only... it’s not. It’s a fake. Go on.  Open it. Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it. I’m not coming back, Hermione. I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I’m not sure where that will lead me... but I’ll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can.  (ALT:  I have to finish what Dumbledore started.  And... I have to do it alone.) Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I’m around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum. Funny, he says the same about you. You’re brilliant.  You both are. Time for the teary farewell. They’ll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth-- Do you have any?  Magic? Absolutely not.  Besides, I’m just a waste of space.  Isn’t that right, Vernon? Well... thanks. See you, Big D. Good riddance. I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley. The Trace? The real one...? No!  Absolutely not! If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me -- This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no. Blimey, Hermione! Here. Hagrid!  We’ve got to help the others! What was that? Hagrid... HAGRID...! Is no one back yet? Are you mad...? A grindylow! Who did this to him? Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me -- I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood? Understood. No one else is going to die.  Not for me. Come with me.  Now. Wedding? I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It’s the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets. Yes. Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing.  If I tell you, I’d be betraying him. Maybe that’s the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that’s going on. To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister? And this would be...? What’s this all about? No idea. That’s it then? Excuse me? You’ll forgive me, Minister.  But it’s a little hard to tell the difference these days. You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say. No, ‘course not.  How are you, Luna? Nice to meet you, sir. Sir?  May I sit down? I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well? I never even knew he had a brother, sir. Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he died. Strange, sir? Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir? Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore. Who are you talking about? Who? Oh, right.  Slipped my mind... Godric’s Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow? Excuse me?  You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too? Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should -- Same. My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow -- You’re joking. Down! Stupefy! Lock the door, get the lights. This one’s name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore. It’s better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they’ll know we were here. How is it they knew we were there? Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago... I have an idea. Mad-Eye...? Lumos. Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know. I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric’s Hollow.  I’m thinking maybe she could help us. To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it... Stop!  I order you! Been spying on us, have you? Ever seen this before? Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too. That’s right.  But there were two, weren’t there? Where’s the other one? Answer her. How do you mean? Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher? Who, Kreacher?  Who was it? Find him. You mean... it remembers me? When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right? Who was she?  This witch? It gets really tricky. This is completely mental. I’m nobody. Apparently so. Are those...? The Ministry must be hiring young these days. How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione? Ron.  You don’t have a wife. Oh.  Right. Look, we’ll go with you -- Ron’s been coming here since he was two years old.  It’s us you should be worrying about. I say if we don’t locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day.  Deal? Accio locket. Ron, it’s me. She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge -- Arthur!  You know you’re being tracked, don’t you? No, Arthur.  It’s a fact.  They’re watching you. I’ll tell you later.  Let’s find Hermione. It’s here... You’re lying.  And one mustn’t tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy! Expecto PATRONUM! Accio Dittany. Hermione.  His arm -- What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place. Don’t be stupid. What’re you doing? Tent?  Where am I supposed to find -- They’re great. No problem. How bad is he? Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle’s grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother. How d’you know? I know.  I felt it too. It’s... it’s like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s -- That’s why we’re going to kill it. Dissendium! Expulso! We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it. No. It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it’s just a flicker.  Can you understand that? He’s found him.  Vol-- You-Know-Who.  He’s found Gregorovitch -- Yes.  How’d you know? You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he’s desperate to have it.  It’s as if his life depends on it. Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear?  Good news? And what gets you through the day? How long before he can travel? You’re not doing enough. Loads. Snatchers. Good to know your enchantments work. We have to leave.  We’re not safe here. Then we’ll go by foot. We’re all hungry. It’ll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep. My turn.  Maybe you could tell me now. Brilliant. O-kay. With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours -- It only takes in that which makes it stronger... ... it can destroy Horcruxes. You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly. There’s only one problem... What’s the problem? Look, don’t be shy.  If you’ve got something to say, spit it out. I thought you knew what you signed up for. I don’t understand.  What part of this isn’t living up to your expectations?  Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas? I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux! Yeah, he would.  D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking? You think I don’t listen!  You think I don’t know what it’s like -- Go then.  But leave that. Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... You were right.  It’s like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it. What do you reckon it means? Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family. Hermione, I’ve been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died -- But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux? Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, ‘course it is.  Obvious, isn’t it? Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open. Hermione... No.  This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else. Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad? Is it -- ? No. Happy Christmas, Hermione. Yeah. C’mon. We look like ordinary Muggles. Relax.  This is right.  I know it. This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them. You’re Bathilda, aren’t you? Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly. She’s gaga, remember? Here.  Let me do that. Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man? His name.  Can you tell me his name? This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he? She wants us to go upstairs. She wants me to go.  Alone. It’s all right.  You stay here. Lumos. Yes. Yes. We got away. Are you alright? You’ve outdone yourself this time. Where are they? Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him? Well? Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he? Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is. Get to the hard part, Hermione. And Dumbledore believed in it? ‘For the Greater Good.’  What does that mean? We’re young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported. Where’s my wand?  I’ll take the watch. Hermione.  Where’s my wand? It’s done. It’s done. Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that. No... Lumos! Accio Sword. Diffindo. Hermione... It was you! And the doe.  That was you as well. My Patronus is a stag. You didn’t see anyone else? But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we’d find it. See that?  It knows.  It’s afraid. Do it. All the more reason. Then why are you here?  Why did you come back? I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don’t hesitate.  I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me. On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside... Stab it, Ron.  Now. Don’t listen to it. Ron.  Don’t listen to it! Ron.  Stab it! Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT! Do it, Ron!  Kill it! After you left, she cried for a week.  She’s like my sister. You’ve sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. That too. Hermione! Fine.  Actually... more than fine. Um... I don’t know? It’s a long story. It’s a long story. Exactly how did you find us? It? Knew what? Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she’ll come round. Yeah... Engorgio. Reducio! Sorry? Jesus.  It was there too. Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall... Not still mad at him, are you? Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I’m Harry Potter.  We met a few months back? Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir.  I promise. Well, sir, we need some help. What’s going on here? Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol... Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it? No. Sorry... I still don’t really understand... Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows? The Stone. Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody. But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me. And I think I’ve actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows. Sir? Who took her, sir? They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate. They exist.  The Hallows. But he only wants the one, the last one.  That’s what he’s been looking for. He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He’ll have it by the end of the night.  He’s found the Elder Wand. Dudely.  Vernon Dudley. The list is wrong.  I told you who I am -- What did you put on me? How long will it last?'"
