We hone in on a snake crawling through the undergrowth.

TITLES

INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME

An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food.
He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what
he's doing and walks to the door.

OLD MAN
Bloody kids.

He leaves the house and heads towards the light.


EXT. DARKNESS

The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing
the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs.
The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is
taking place and listens on.

WORMTAIL
Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only
meant... perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy..

VOLDEMORT
NO! The boy is everything, it cannot
be done without him and it WILL be done
exactly as I say.

UNKNOWN MAN
I will not disappoint you my lord.


VOLDEMORT
Good. First, gather our old comrades.
Send them a sign.

A snake slithers past the old man and into the room.

VOLDEMORT
Nagini tells me the old caretaker is
standing outside the door.

Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The
old man looks terrified.

VOLDEMORT
Step aside so I can give our guest a
proper greeting.

A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.



INT. BEDROOM

HERMIONE
Harry!

Harry is flustered and still panicing.

HERMIONE
Are you alright?

HARRY
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get
here?

HERMIONE
Just now. You?

HARRY
Last night.

Hermione goes over to Ron's bed.

HERMIONE
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!

RON
Bloody hell.

HERMIONE
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go
back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother
says breakfast's ready.


EXT. GRASSLAND

HARRY
Where are we actually going?

RON
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?


ARTHUR
Haven't the foggiest, keep up!

AMOS
Arthur! It's about time son.

ARTHUR
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of
a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
everyone, he works with me at the ministry.
And this strapping young lad must be
Cedric, am I right?

CEDRIC
Yes sir.

AMOS
Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.


HARRY
Yes sir. This way.

AMOS
Great great pleasure.

They shake hands.

HARRY
Pleasure to meet you too sir.

They walk on up the hill.

ARTHUR
That's it sir, just over there.

AMOS
Shall we? We don't want to be late.


Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.

HARRY
Why are they all standing around that
manky old boot?

FRED
That isn't just any old manky boot mate.


GEORGE
It's a portkey.

Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.

AMOS
Time to go. Ready?

HARRY
What's a 'portkey'?

AMOS
After 3. One... Two...

ARTHUR
Harry!

Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot.

AMOS
Three!

There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through
the air. Everyone cheers.

ARTHUR
Let go kids!

HERMIONE
What??

ARTHUR
Let! Go!

Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with
a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.


ARTHUR
I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?


Cedric helps Harry to his feet.

HARRY
Thanks.

They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd
gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.

ARTHUR
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch
World Cup!

They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing
and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small
tent.

AMOS
Parting of the waves I think old chap,
see you at the match.

Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.

HARRY
See ya later Cedric.

ARTHUR
Home sweet home.


INT. TENT

They enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the
outside.

ARTHUR
Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron,
get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.


TWINS
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.

ARTHUR
Feet off the table.

TWINS
Feet off the table.

They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon
as Arthur has walked past.

HARRY
(Smiling) I love magic.


EXT. HILLSIDE

We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have
a huge number of floors.

INT. STADIUM

The Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats.

RON
Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?

Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them.

LUCIUS
Well put it this way, if it rains...
you'll be the first to know

DRACO
Father and I are in the minister's box,
by personal invitation of Cornelius
Fudge himself.

LUCIUS
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with
these people. Do enjoy yourself won't
you. While you can.

The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.

ARTHUR
Come on up, take your seats. I told
you these seats would be worth waiting
for.

GEORGE
Come on!

FRED
It's the Irish!

Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms
leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun
appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited.


GEORGE
Here come the Bulgarians!

Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his
broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins
to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'.

WEASLEYS
Krum!!!

GEORGE
Yes!

Viktor Krum waves to the crowd.

ANNOUNCER
Good evening! It gives me great pleasure
to welcome each and every one of you
to the final of the 422nd Quidditch
World Cup. Let the match begin!


INT. TENT

RON
There's no one like Krum. He's like
a bird the way he rides the wind. He's
more than an athlete, he's an artist.


The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'.


GINNY
Think you're in love Ron?

TWINS
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor
I do!

Harry joins in.

BOYS
When we're apart my heart beats only
for youuu!

FRED
Sounds like the irish have got their
pride on.

ARTHUR
Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've
gotta get out of here. Now.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT

ARTHUR
Get back to the portkey everybody, and
stick together. Fred, George... Ginny
is your responsibility.

Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking
across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced
and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious.


EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSED

The crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking
at things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a
large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from
it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry stirs and witnesses
the man standing there. Harry runs. The familiar voices of Ron
and Hermione are calling for him.

RON
Been looking for you for ages. Thought
we lost you.

HARRY
What is THAT?

They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his
head in pain. Suddenly they are fired on.

ARTHUR
Stop! That's my son.

Arthur and others approach.

ARTHUR
Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?


BARTY
Which of you conjured this?

ARTHUR
You can't possibly..

BARTY
Do not lie! You have been discovered
at the scene of the crime!

HARRY
Crime?

ARTHUR
Barty, they're just kids.

HARRY
What crime?

HERMIONE
Harry it's his mark.

HARRY
Those people tonight, in the masks...
they're his too aren't they? they're
his followers.

BARTY
Follow me.

HARRY
There was a man. Before. There.

BARTY
All of you, this way.

ARTHUR
Harry, who?

HARRY
I dunno. I didn't see his face.


INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE

Harry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. A voice calls
out.

LADY OFFSCREEN
Anything from the trolley? Anything
from the trolley?

The lady appears at their door.

LADY
Anything from the trolley dears?

RON
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.


Ron sees he hasn't enough money.

RON
On second thought, just the drewbals.


HARRY
It's alright I'll get it.

RON
Just the drewbals, thanks.

Cho Chan walks up to the trolley.

CHO
Two pumpkin pasties please.

Harry and Cho look at each other and smile.

CHO
Thank you.

LADY
Anything sweet for you dear?

HARRY
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.

HERMIONE
This is horrible, how can the ministry
not know who conjured it. Isn't there
any security or?

RON
Loads according to Dad, that's what
worried them so much. Happened right
under their noses.

Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head.

HERMIONE
It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.


HARRY
I'm fine.

HERMIONE
You know Sirius will want to hear about
this. What you saw at the world cup,
and the dream.

Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope
and gives it to an owl.


EXT. HOGWARTS

We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage
coming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer.

HAGRID
Clear the runway.

HARRY
Well there's something you don't see
every day.

A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too.


DUMBLEDORE
Now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement. This
castle will not only be your home this
year but home to some very special guests
as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...


A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers
something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion.

DUMBLEDORE
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host
a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament.
Now for those of you who do not know,
the tri-wizard tournament brings together
three schools for a series of magical
contests. From each school a single
contestant is selected to compete. Now
let me be clear, if choosen you stand
alone. And trust me when I say these
contests are not for the faint hearted,
but more of that later. For now please
join me in welcoming the lovely ladies
of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic
and their headmistress Madam Maxime.


A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release
butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds.

STUDENT
Blimey, that's one big woman.

DUMBLEDORE
And now our friends from the north,
please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang
and the high master Igor Karkaroff.


A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs,
twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the
ground with a spark effect.

RON
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!

The boys breathe some fire.

IGOR
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE
Igor.

They embrace.


EXT. HOGWARTS - STORMY - NIGHT

MADAME MAXIME
Professor Dumbledore, my horses have
travelled a long way. They will need
attending to.

DUMBLEDORE
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper
Hagrid's more than capable of seeing
to them.

MADAME MAXIME
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink
only single malt whiskey.

The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork
into his hand.

MAN
You idiot!


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
Your attention please! I would like
to say a few words. Eternal glory, that
is what awaits the student who wins
the tri-wizard tournament. But to do
this that student must survive three
tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.


FRED
Wicked.

DUMBLEDORE
For this reason the ministry has seen
fit to impose a new rule. To explain
all this we have the head of the department
of international magic cooperation Mister
Bartimus Crouch.

Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof
and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he
casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.


RON
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.

HERMIONE
Alastor Moody? The aura.

RON
He was a catcher. Half the cells in
Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's
supposed to be mad as a hatter though
these days.

This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry
through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he
goes.

DUMBLEDORE
My dear old friend, thanks for coming.


MAD-EYE
That stupid roof.

Mad-Eye takes a drink.

PUPIL
What's that he's drinking do you suppose?


HARRY
I don't know but I don't think it's
Pumpkin Juice.

BARTY
After much deliberation the ministry
has concluded that for their own safety
no student under the age of seventeen
shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the tri-wizard tournament.
This decision is final.

The crowd is unsettled, people are booing.

GEORGE
That's rubbish! You don't know what
you're doing!

DUMBLEDORE
Silence!

Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing
a blue flame.

DUMBLEDORE
The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to
submit themselves for the tournament
merely write their name upon a piece
of parchment and throw it in the flame
before this hour on Thursday night.
Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's
no turning back. As from this moment
the tri-wizard tournament has begun.



INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

We see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet
is still burning and close the door behind him.


INT. CLASSROOM

MAD-EYE
Alastor Moody.

He writes his name on the board.

MAD-EYE
Ministry malcontent. And your new defence
against the dark arts teacher. I'm here
because Dumbledore asked me, end of
story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?
When it comes to the dark arts, I believe
in a practical approach. But first,
which of you can tell me how many unforgivable
curses there are?

HERMIONE
Three sir.

MAD-EYE
And they are so named?

HERMIONE
Because they are unforgivable. Use of
any one of them will...

MAD-EYE
Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban.
Correct. Now the ministry says you're
too young to see what these curses do.
I say different! You need to know what
you're up against, you need to be prepared,
you need to find somewhere else to put
your chewing gum other than the underside
of your desk Mr Finnigan!

PUPIL
Aw no way, the old codger can see out
the back of his head.

Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger.

MAD-EYE
So, which curse shall we see first?
WEASLEY!

RON
Yes...

MAD-EYE
Give us a curse.

RON
Well, my dad did tell me about one...
The imperious curse.

MAD-EYE
Ahhh yes, your father would know all
about that. Gave the ministry quite
a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps
this will show you why.

Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.

MAD-EYE
Hello. What a little beauty.

He uses his wand to send it around the class.

MAD-EYE
Don't worry. Completely harmless.

The class is unsettled.

MAD-EYE
But if she bites... she's lethal!

Draco laughs.

MAD-EYE
What are you laughing at?

Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.

MAD-EYE
Talented isn't she? What shall I have
her do next? Jump out the window? Drown
herself?

Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.


MAD-EYE
Scores of witches and wizards have claimed
that they only do did you-know-whose
bidding under the influence of the imperious
curse. But here's the rub, how do we
sort out the liars? Another.. another..
Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.


Neville Longbottom stands.

MAD-EYE
Professor Sprout tells me you have an
aptitude for herbology.

NEVILLE
There's the um... The cruciatus curse.


MAD-EYE
Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly
nasty. The torture curse.

Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.


HERMIONE
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
him, stop it!

Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider
which is still making a noise.

MAD-EYE
Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable
curse Miss Granger.

Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.


MAD-EYE
The killing curse. Only one person is
known to have survived it. And he's
sitting in this room.

He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink.


INT. STAIRS

RON
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented
of course. Terrifying to be in the same
room with, he's really BEEN there you
know.

HERMIONE
There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,
and to perform them in a classroom.
I mean did you see Neville's face.


They see a boy on the stairs facing the window.

HERMIONE
Neville?

Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder.

MAD-EYE
Son. You alright?

Neville nods.

MAD-EYE
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I
want to show you something.


INT. GOBLET ROOM

Older students are placing their names into the flame and others
are applauding, Cedric is one of them.

RON
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't
it? In three years from now we'll be
old enough to be choosen.

HARRY
Yeah well rather you than me.

The twins come up cheering.

GEORGE
Thank you thank you, well lads we've
done it.

FRED
Cooked it up just this morning.

HERMIONE
It's not going to work.

FRED
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.

HERMIONE
You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore
drew it himself.

FRED
So?

HERMIONE
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't
possibly be fooled by something pathetically
dimwitted such as an age potion.

GEORGE
That's why it's so brilliant.

GEORGE
Ready Fred?

FRED
Ready George?

They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names
in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're
flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have
full heads of grey hair and beards.

GEORGE
You said..

Fred You said..

They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The
room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts
his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles.



INT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT

DUMBLEDORE
Sit down please. And now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the champions
selection!

Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name
comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously.

DUMBLEDORE
The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor
Krum!

The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out.

DUMBLEDORE
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur
Delacour

The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes
out.

DUMBLEDORE
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.


Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage.

DUMBLEDORE
Excellent! we now have our three champions!
But in the end only one will go down
in history. Only one will hoist this
chalice of champions, this vessel of
victory the tri-wizard cup!

People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another
name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter. Harry Potter?

HAGRID
No... No.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter!

HERMIONE
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.


Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices
in the crowd shout out.

VOICE
He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen
yet.


INT. ROOM

Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts
in and grabs Harry.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Did you put your name in the
goblet of fire?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
Did you ask one of the older students
to do it for you?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
You're absolutely sure?

HARRY
Yes sir.

MADAME MAXIME
Well of course he is lying.

MAD-EYE
The hell he is. The goblet of fire is
an exceptionally powerful magical object,
only an exceptionally powerful conjurer
could have hoodwinked it. Magic way
beyond the talents of a fourth year.


IGOR
You seem to have given this a fair bit
of thought Mad-Eye.

MAD-EYE
It was once my job to think as dark
wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?


DUMBLEDORE
That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this
to you Barty.

BARTY
The rules are absolute, the goblet of
fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of
tonight... a tri-wizards champion.



INT. DARKENED TOWER ROOM

MCGONAGALL
This can't go on Albus. First the dark
mark, now this?

DUMBLEDORE
What do you suggest Minerva?

MCGONAGALL
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.


DUMBLEDORE
You heard Barty the rules are clear.


MCGONAGALL
Well the devil with Barty and his rules.
And since when did you accomodate them...


SNAPE
Master I too find it difficult to believe
this mere coincidence, if we are to
truly discover the meaning of these
events perhaps we should for the time
being let them unfold.

MCGONAGALL
Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter
is a boy not a piece of meat.

DUMBLEDORE
I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep
an eye on Harry will you?

MAD-EYE
I can do that.

DUMBLEDORE
Don't let him know though, he must be
anxious enough as it is... knowing what
lies ahead. Then again, we all are.



INT. BEDROOM

RON
How did you do it?

Harry is silent.

RON
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could
have let your best friend know though.


HARRY
Let you know what?

RON
You know bloody well what.

HARRY
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron.
Okay? You're being stupid.

RON
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry
Potter's stupid friend.

HARRY
I didn't put my name in that cup. I
don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna
be.. Look, I don't know what happened
tonight and I don't know why, it just
did ok.

RON
Piss off.


INT. HOGWARTS

A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed
colorfully.

RITA
What a charismatic quartet. Hello!


The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group.
She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands.

RITA
I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily
prophet. But of course you know that
don't you. It's you we don't know, you're
the news. What quirks lurk beneath those
rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles
mask? does courage lie beneath those
curls? In short, what makes a champion
tick. Me, myself and I want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers. So,
who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall
we start with the youngest. Lovely.


She takes Harry by the hand into a closet.

RITA
This is cosy.

HARRY
It's a broomcupboard.

RITA
You should feel right at home then.
Don't mind if I use the quill do you?


HARRY
Oh, no.

RITA
So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of
twelve..

HARRY
I'm fourteen.

RITA
...about to compete against three students.
Not only vastly more emotionally mature
than yourself but have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest
daydreams. Concerned?

HARRY
I dunno I haven't really thought about
it.

RITA
Course you're not just any ordinary
boy of twelve are you...

HARRY
Fourteen.

RITA
The story's legend. Do you think it
was the trauma of your past that made
you so keen to enter such a dangerous
tournament.

HARRY
No I didn't enter.

RITA
Course you didn't. Everyone loves a
rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch
that last. Speaking of your parents,
were they alive, how do you think they'd
feel? proud? or concerned that your
attitude shows at best a pathological
need for attention, at worst a psychotic
deathwish.

HARRY
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes
aren't glistening with the ghosts of
my past.


INT. ROOFTOP

An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins
to read.

SIR
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending
Edward. It was since the world cup and
the ministry's been intercepting more
and more owls and she's too easily recognised.
We need to talk Harry. Face to face.
Meet me in the Griffindore common room
at one o clock this Saturday night and
make sure you're alone. P.S....

The owl nips Harry's finger.

HARRY
AGH!

SIR
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.



INT. GRIFFINDORE COMMON ROOM

HARRY
Sirius?

Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS
ARE SELECTED" and reads.

RITA
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 12, suspect
entrant in the tri-wizard tournament.
His eyes swimming with the ghosts of
his...

Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and
puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears
in it.

HARRY
Sirius?! How...

SIR
I don't have much time Harry so let
me get straight to it. Did you or did
you not put your name into the goblet
of fire?

HARRY
No!

SIR
Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about
this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail
and Voldemort, but who was the third
man in the room?

HARRY
I dunno.

SIR
You didn't hear a name?

HARRY
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a
job to do. Something important.

SIR
What was that?

HARRY
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he
was gonna use this man to get to me.
I mean it was only a dream right?


SIR
Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry,
the deatheaters at the world cup, your
name rising from that goblet these are
not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't
safe any more.

HARRY
What are you saying?

SIR
I'm saying the devils are inside the
walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater.
And no one, no one stops being a deatheater.
Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of
stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.


HARRY
Do you think one of them put my name
in the goblet?

SIR
I haven't a clue who put your name in
that goblet Harry but whoever did it
is no friend to you. People die in this
tournament.

HARRY
I'm not ready for this Sirius.

SIR
You don't have a choice.

HARRY
Someone's coming!

SIR
Keep your friends close Harry.

Ron enters the room.

RON
Who you talking to?

HARRY
Who says I was talking to anyone.

RON
I heard voices.

HARRY
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't
be the first time.

RON
You're probably just practicing for
your next interview I expect.

Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone.
The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".



EXT. LAKESIDE

NEVILLE
Amazing. Amazing.

HARRY
Neville! You're doing it again!

NEVILLE
Oh, right sorry.

HARRY
(reading a book) Magical water plants
of the highland Lochs?

NEVILLE
Moody gave it to me. That day we had
tea.

Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them.

HERMIONE
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been
through enough people why don't you
just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What
do you want me to say again?

Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry
are not on speaking terms.

Hermione walks up to Harry.

HERMIONE
Ronald would like me to tell you that
Seamus told him that Dean was told by
Parvati that Hagrid was looking for
you.

HARRY
Is that right? Well.... what?

HERMIONE
Uhhh...

She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back.

HERMIONE
Dean was told by Parvati that... Please
don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's
looking for you.

HARRY
Well you can tell Ronald...

HERMIONE
I'm NOT an owl!


INT. FOREST

Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest.

HAGRID
Did you bring your father's cloak like
I asked you?

HARRY
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where
are we going?

HAGRID
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention
this is important.

HARRY
What's with the flower? Hagrid have
you combed your hair?

Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big
red flower.

HAGRID
As a matter of fact I have. You might
like to try the same thing now and again.


We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid.

MADAME MAXIME
Hagrid?

HAGRID
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.

Harry does as he's told.

HAGRID
Bonsoir Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming,
I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten
me.

HAGRID
Couldn't forget you Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
What is it you want to show me? When
we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.


HAGRID
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.


A dragon nearby gives a loud roar.

MADAME MAXIME
Ahh, c'est magnifique!

In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring
and breathing fire.

MADAME MAXIME
Can we get closer?

HARRY
Dragons? That's the first task? You're
joking.

HAGRID
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood
creatures.

A huge flame fires up.

HAGRID
Although, I have to admit that horntail
is a right nasty piece of work. Poor
Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you
know.

HARRY
Ron was here?

HAGRID
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped
bring him over from Romania. Didn't
Ron tell you that?

HARRY
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.



EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow
background. Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background
with the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other
pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs
past.

BOY
Cedric rules!

HARRY
Thanks.

Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.

BOY
Like the badge?

HARRY
Excuse me..

They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric
who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl
off more insults.

HARRY
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?

CEDRIC
Alright.

They walk away some distance.

HARRY
Dragons. That's the first task. They've
got one for each of us.

CEDRIC
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,
do they...?

HARRY
Yes.

CEDRIC
Right. Hey listen, about the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them.


HARRY
Don't worry about it.

Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them.

HARRY
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you
know that?

RON
You think so?

HARRY
I know so.

RON
Anything else?

HARRY
Yeah. Stay away from me.

RON
Fine.


Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.

DRACO
Why so tense Potter? My father and I
have a bet you see. I don't think you're
gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.
He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
FIVE.

HARRY
I don't give a damn what you or your
father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and
cruel, and you're just pathetic.

Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye
appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.

MAD-EYE
I'll teach you to cast when someone's
back is turned.

MCGONAGALL
Professor Moody what are you doing?


MAD-EYE
Teaching.

MCGONAGALL
Is that a student?

MAD-EYE
Technically it's a ferret.

Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the
trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.
Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.
Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back
to normal.

DRACO
My father will hear about this!

MAD-EYE
Is that a threat!

Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.

MAD-EYE
I could tell you stories about your
father that would curl even your greasy
hair boy! It doesn't end here!

MCGONAGALL
We never use transfigration as a punishment,
surely Dumbledore told you that.

MAD-EYE
He might've mentioned it.

MCGONAGALL
Well you will do well to remember it.


MAD-EYE
(To Harry) come with me.


INT. MAD-EYE'S ROOM

Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.

MAD-EYE
That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an
eye on my enemies. If I can see the
whites of their eyes they're standing
right behind me.

A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes.

MAD-EYE
Wouldn't even bother telling you what's
in ther. You wouldn't believe it if
I did. Now... what are you going to
do about your dragon?

HARRY
Oh... um... You know I just thought
I'd...

MAD-EYE
Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,
by your age he could take a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the
time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a
fairy princess as I am. As for Krum,
his head may be filled with sawdust
but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have
a strategy, and you can bet that it'll
play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come
on Potter. What are your strengths?


HARRY
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm
a fair flyer.

MAD-EYE
Better than fair the way I heard it.


HARRY
But I'm not allowed a broom.

MAD-EYE
You're allowed a wand.


EXT. ARENA - TOURNAMENT STAGE 1

The crowds are cheering, people are taking bets.


INT. WAITING TENT

Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door
whispering in.

HERMIONE
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?

HARRY
Yeah.

HERMIONE
How are you feeling? OK? The key is
to concentrate. After that you just
have to...

HARRY
Battle a dragon.

Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes,
Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches.

RITA
Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything
goes unfortunately today you might make
the front page.

VIKTOR
(To Rita) You have no business here.
This tent is for champions and friends.


RITA
No matter. We've got what we wanted.


Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters.

DUMBLEDORE
Good day champions. Gather round please.
Now you've waited, you've wondered and
at last the moment has arrived. The
moment only four of you can fully appreciate.


The champions gather around him in a circle.

DUMBLEDORE
What are you doing here Miss Granger?


HERMIONE
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty. The bag.

BARTY
Champions, in a circle around me. Miss
Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter
over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if
you will...

Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon.


BARTY
The welsh green. Mr Krum...

Viktor takes another out

BARTY
The chinese fireball. Oooooh.

Cedric picks one.

BARTY
The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...


HARRY
The horntail...

BARTY
What's that boy?

HARRY
Nothing.

Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon.

BARTY
The hungarian horntail. These represent
very real dragons, each of which has
been given a golden egg to protect.
Your objective is simple, collect the
egg. This you must do, for each egg
contains a clue without which you cannot
hope to proceed to the next task. Any
questions?

DUMBLEDORE
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory
the sound of the cannon...

The cannon fires immediately.

Transcribed by IMSDb.com


INT. TENT

Harry is sitting alone nervously.

DUMBLEDORE
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of
our champions have now faced their dragons
and so each one of them will proceed
to the next task. And now our fourth
and final contestant.

Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name.
He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but
the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as
the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena.


HERMIONE
Your wand harry! Your wand!

Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon
gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look
stunned.


EXT. HOGWARTS SKY

Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings.
The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands
on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon
is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry
reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets
go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him.
He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area
with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon
crashes into it and falls into the water.


INT. ARENA

The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us
and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg.



INT. HOGWARTS

Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering.
The Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders.

GEORGE
We knew you wouldn't die Harry.

FRED
Lose a leg.

GEORGE
Or an arm.

FRED
Pack it in altogether.

TWINS
NEVER!

SEAMUS
Go on Harry, what's the clue?

Seamus hands Harry the golden egg.

HARRY
Who wants me to open it? You want me
to open it?

He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes
it again.

HARRY
What the bloody hell was that?

Ron appears in the doorway.

FRED
Alright everyone, go back to your knitting.
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosey sods listening
in.

RON
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the goblet of
fire.

HARRY
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.


RON
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done
it. Everyone was saying it behind your
back.

HARRY
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads
better.

RON
At least I warned you about the dragons.


HARRY
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.


RON
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus
told me that Parvati told Dean that
Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never
actually told me anything, so it was
really me all along. I thought you'd
be alright, you know, after you figured
that out.

HARRY
Who could possibly figure that out?
That's completely mental.

RON
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a
bit distraught.

HERMIONE
Boys.


INT. CLASSROOM

Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink
from his mouth. They laugh at him.

HERMIONE
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this!
I can't believe it she's done it again.
Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl
seems to be developing a taste for famous
wizards. Her latest prey sources report
is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon
Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry
Potter's taking this latest emotional
blow.

A young boy walks up holding a package.

NIGEL
Parcel for you Mr Weasley.

RON
Thank you Nigel.

Nigel is gazing at Harry.

RON
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.

Nigel leaves.

RON
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum
sent me a dress??

HARRY
Well it does match your eyes. Is there
a bonnet?

RON
Ginny these must be for you.

GINNY
I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.


Hermione laughs.

RON
What are you on about?

HERMIONE
They're not for Ginny they're for you!
Dress robes.

RON
Dress robes? for what?


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

MCGONAGALL
The yule ball has been a tradition of
the tri-wizard tournament since its
inception. On Christmas eve night we
and our guests gather in the great hall
for well mannered frivolity. As representitives
of the host school I expect each and
every one of you to put your best foot
forward, and I mean this literally because
the yule ball is first and foremost...
a dance.

Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem
a lot more excited.

MCGONAGALL
Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore
has commanded the respect of the wizard
world for nearly ten centuries. I will
not have you in the course of a single
evening besmirching that name by behaving
like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.


FRED
(Whispering to George) Try saying that
five times faster.

They try.

MCGONAGALL
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the
body breathe, inside every girl a secret
swan slumbers longing to burst forth
and take flight.

RON
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about
to burst out of Hilary but I don't think
it's a swan.

MCGONAGALL
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared
to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join
me.

She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance.

MCGONAGALL
Now, place your right hand on my waist.


RON
Where?

MCGONAGALL
My waist.

He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd.

MCGONAGALL
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...

The music starts.

MCGONAGALL
One two three, one two three, one two
three.

HARRY
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna
let him forget this are you?

TWINS
Never.

MCGONAGALL
Everybody come together.

The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all
still seated.

MCGONAGALL
Boys, on your feet.

Neville stands.


EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

HARRY
Why do they always have to travel in
packs? How are you supposed to get one
alone to ask them...

RON
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If
you can't get a date who can?

HARRY
I think I'd take the dragon right now.


Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs.



INT. HOGWARTS

Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together.

HAGRID
I take after my mum. Though I didn't
know her very well, she left when I
was about three. No, not the maternal
sort her, broke my dad's heart though.
You know he was a tiny little fellow
my dad, I could pick him up with one
hand by the age of six and put him up
in the dresser.

They laugh together and have a moment.

HAGRID
And then he died when I was still in
school. So I had to make me own way
as it were. But enough of me, what about
you!


EXT. LAKESIDE

Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around.



INT. CLASSROOM

RON
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the
only ones in our year without dates.


Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head.

RON
Well, us and Neville!

HARRY
But then again he can take himself.


HERMIONE
It might interest you to know that Neville's
already got someone.

Ron gasps.

RON
Now I'm really depressed.

Fred hands Ron a note, it reads "GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD
ONES WILL HAVE GONE!".

RON
Well Hermione, you're a girl.

HERMIONE
Oh well spotted.

RON
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone. For a girl it's just
sad.

HERMIONE
I won't be going alone because believe
it or not someone's asked me. And I
said yes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Hermione storms off.

RON
Look. We've just got to grit our teeth
and do it. Tonight when we get back
to the common room, we'll both have
partners. Agreed?

HARRY
Agreed.


EXT. HOGWARTS - SNOWY

Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps
into Cho who has come around the corner.

CHO
Harry!

HARRY
Cho!

CHO
Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a
bit icey at the top.

HARRY
Ok thanks. Cho?

CHO
Yes?

HARRY
Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me?


CHO
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

HARRY
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you
wanted to go to the ball with me.


CHO
Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's
already asked me. And well I've said
I'll go with him.

HARRY
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.


CHO
Harry I really am sorry.


INT. COMMON ROOM

Ron is being helped into the room, he looks shaky.

HARRY
What happened to you?

GIRL
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

HERMIONE
What?

HARRY
What did she say?

HERMIONE
No of course.

Ron shakes his head.

HERMIONE
She said yes??

HARRY
Don't be silly.

RON
There she was walking by. You know I
like it when they walk. I couldn't help
it, it just sort of slipped out.

GIRL
Actually he sort of screamed at her,
it was a bit frightening.

HARRY
What did you do then?

RON
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut
out for this Harry. I don't know what
got into me.

The Patil twins walk past.

PATILS
Hi Harry.

HARRY
Hey!


INT. DANCEHALL

Soft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the
hall.


ELSEWHERE

Ron is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced
and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit.

RON
What are those??

HARRY
My dress robes.

RON
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy
little collar.

HARRY
Well I expect yours are more traditional.


RON
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look
like my great aunt Tessie.

He sniffs at his clothes.

RON
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder
me Harry.


INT. DANCEHALL

Harry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron
is fidgeting with his outfit.

HARRY
Leave it alone.

RON
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room
crying her eyes out.

HARRY
Who?

RON
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd
you think she wouldn't tell us who she's
coming with?

HARRY
Because we'd take the mickey out of
her if she did.

RON
Because nobody asked her. I would have
taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding
proud.

The boys approach the Patil twins.

PARVATI
Hello boys. Don't you look...

She looks at Ron.

PARVATI
... dashing.

MCGONAGALL
Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss
Patil ready?

HARRY
Ready professor?

MCGONAGALL
To dance. It's traditional that the
three champions or in this case four
are the first to dance. Surely I told
you that.

HARRY
No.

MCGONAGALL
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your
Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great
hall with Miss Patil.

Hermione enters the room all dressed up.

PARVATI
She looks beautiful.

HARRY
Yeah she does.

Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and
they walk together.

PADMA
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With
Viktor Krum??

RON
No. Absolutely not.

Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with
their partners.

PARVATI
Harry. Take my waist.

HARRY
What?

PARVATI
Now.

They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall,
Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits
on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now
rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from
Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates
are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes
up after a great time with Viktor.

HERMIONE
Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks.
Care to join us?

RON
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.


HERMIONE
What's got your wand in a knot?

RON
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising
with the enemy.

HERMIONE
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?
Besides, the whole point of the tournament
is international magical cooperation,
to make friends.

RON
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than
friendship on his mind.

Hermione walks off.

PADMA
Are you going to ask me to dance or
not?

RON
No.


LATER

RON
(To Hermione) He's using you.

HERMIONE
How dare you! Besides I can take care
of myself.

RON
Doubt it. He's way too old.

HERMIONE
What? What? That's what you think?


RON
Yeah that is what I think.

HERMIONE
You know the solution then don't you.


RON
Go on.

HERMIONE
Next time there's a ball pluck up the
courage and ask me before somebody else
does, and not as a last resort.

RON
Well that's completely off the point.
Harry...

Harry walks up.

HERMIONE
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off
to bed both of you.

Harry and Ron walk away.

RON
They get scary when they get older.


HERMIONE
Ron you spoil everything!


INT. BEDROOM

NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE

We're back in the old house.

VOLDERMORT
Let me see it again.

A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on
the arm.

VOLDEMORT
Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!
At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can
give our guest a proper greeting!


Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking
up to his bed. It's Neville.

NEVILLE
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!


He chuckles and dances off.


EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS

HERMIONE
Harry you told me you'd figured the
egg out weeks ago. The task is two days
from now.

HARRY
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

HERMIONE
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually
talk about the tournament. Actually
we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's
more of a physical being. I just mean
he's not particularly... Mostly he watches
me study. It's a bit annoying actually.
You are trying to figure this egg out
aren't you?

HARRY
What's that supposed to mean?

HERMIONE
I mean these tasks are supposed to test
you, in the most brutal way they're
almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for
you. You got by the dragon mostly on
nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be
enough this time.

CEDRIC
Hey Potter.

HARRY
Cedric.

CEDRIC
How are you?

HARRY
Spectacular.

CEDRIC
Look I realise I never really thanked
you properly for tipping me off about
those dragons.

HARRY
Forget about it. I'm sure you would
have done the same for me.

CEDRIC
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom
on the fifth floor?

Harry nods.

CEDRIC
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just
take your egg and mull things over in
the hot water.


INT. BATHROOM

Harry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has
his golden egg on the side.

HARRY
I must be out of my mind.

He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.

MYRTLE
I'd try putting it in the water if I
were you.

HARRY
Myrtle!

MYRTLE
Long time no see.

The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.

MYRTLE
I was circling a blocked drain the other
day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice
potion. Not being a bad boy again are
you Harry?

HARRY
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit.
Myrtle, did you say try putting it in
the water?

Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water.

MYRTLE
Well. That's what he did. The other
boy, the handsome one. Cedric.

Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water.

MYRTLE
Well go on, open it.

Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.


VOICE SINGING
Come seek us where our voices sound.
We cannot sing above the ground. An
hour long you'll have to look, to recover
what we took.

HARRY
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the
black lake are there?

MYRTLE
Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to
riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles
were gone...

Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.


INT. COMMON ROOM

HERMIONE
Harry, tell me again.

HARRY
Come seek us where our voices sound.


HERMIONE
The black lake, that's obvious.

HARRY
An hour long you'll have to look.

HERMIONE
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially
problematic

HARRY
Potentially problematic? When was the
last time you held your breath under
the water for an hour Hermione?

HERMIONE
Look Harry, we can do this. The three
of us can figure it out.

Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.

MAD-EYE
Hate to break up this scholar session
but Professor McGonagall would like
to see you in her office. Not you Potter,
just Weasly and Granger.

HERMIONE
But sir, the second task is only hours
away and...

MAD-EYE
Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared
by now and could do with a good night's
sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!

Neville appears from behind a bookcase.

MAD-EYE
Why don't you help Potter put his books
back.

NEVILLE
You know, if you're interested in plants
you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide
to Herbology. Do you know there's a
wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity
resistant trees?

HARRY
Neville. No offense, but I really don't
care about plants. Now if there's a
Tibetan turnip that will allow me to
breathe underwater for an hour then
great.

NEVILLE
I don't know about a turnip but you
can always use gilliweed.


EXT. LAKESIDE

The Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking
along with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand.


HARRY
You're sure about this Neville.

NEVILLE
Absolutely.

HARRY
For an hour.

NEVILLE
Most likely.

HARRY
Most likely?

NEVILLE
Well there is some debate among herbologists
as to the effects of freshwater versus
saltwater.

HARRY
You're telling me this now? You must
be joking.

NEVILLE
I just wanted to help.

HARRY
Well that makes you sight better than
Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?


NEVILLE
You seem a little tense Harry.

HARRY
Do I?

DUMBLEDORE
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the
second task. Last night something was
stolen from each of our champions. A
treasure of sorts. These four treasures,
one for each champion, now lie on the
bottom of the black lake. In order to
win each champion need only find their
treasure and return to the surface.
Simple enough. Except for this, they
will have one hour to do so and one
hour only. After that they'll be on
their own.

MAD-EYE
(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.


Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.

DUMBLEDORE
(Continued) You may begin at the start
of the cannon.

The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of
them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of
gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed.



EXT. ABOVE WATER

SEAMUS
What's the matter with him?

FRIEND
I don't know I can't see him.

NEVILLE
Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!


Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer.



EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing.
We see Fleur get trapped, she screams.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

DUMBLEDORE
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons
champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately
been forced to retire. She will take
no further part in this task.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He
finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons
tied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho
with him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious
merpeople appear.

HARRY
But she's my friend too!

MERPERSON
Only one.

What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that
it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for
the surface. Harry frees Ron.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione
next, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls
look worried.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable
to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the
surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down,
he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're
helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater
Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he
flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry!

BARTY
Get him another towel.

DUMBLEDORE
I want all the judges over here now.


FLEUR
(To Harry) You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save. My little
sister!

Fleur kisses Harry on the face.

FLEUR
Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron).
You helped!

RON
Well... yeah... a bit

Fleur kisses him too.

RON
Merci.

Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel.

HERMIONE
Harry!

HARRY
Hermione

HERMIONE
Are you alright? You must be freezing!
Personally I think you behaved admirably.


Hermione kisses Harry on the head.

HARRY
I finished last Hermione.

HERMIONE
Next to last.

DUMBLEDORE
Attention! Attention! The winner is...
Mr Diggory!

Cedric and his friends cheer.

DUMBLEDORE
For showing unique command of the bubblehead
shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would
have finished first had it not been
for his determination to rescue not
only Mr Weasly but the others as well.
We've agreed to award him second place!
For outstanding moral fibre.


As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering
him.

FRED
All that moral fibre eh?

RON
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns
out right.

GEORGE
Well done 'moral fibre'.


Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry.

BARTY
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement.
Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't
spoken, after all your story is one
I've heard many times. Quite remarkable.
Tragic of course, to lose one's family.
Never whole again are we? Still, life
goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure
your parents would be very proud today
Potter.

Mad-Eye approaches them.

MAD-EYE
Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter
into one of the ministry's summer internships
are we? Last boy who went into the department
of ministries never came out!

Barty walks away from him.

MAD-EYE
And they say I'm mad.


EXT. DARK FOREST

HAGRID
So I remember, I remember when I first
met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits
I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded
me of myself a little. And here we all
are, four years later.

RON
We're still misfits.

HAGRID
Maybe. But we've all got each other,
and Harry of course. Soon to be! The
youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's
ever been! Hooray!

They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head
in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless.


HARRY
Mr Crouch?


INT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
A man has died here. And he won't be
the last, you must take action.

FUDGE
I will not. In times like these the
wizard world looks to its leaders for
strength Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Then for once show them some.

FUDGE
The tri-wizard tournament will not be
cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.


DUMBLEDORE
But surely that is what's right, no
matter what others think.

FUDGE
What did you say? What did you say to
me?

MAD-EYE
Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest
you to know that this conversation is
no longer private.

Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.

FUDGE
Harry! Harry how good to see you again.


HARRY
I can come back later Professor.

DUMBLEDORE
Oh not necessary Harry the minister
and I are done. I'll be back in a moment.
Minister, after you. Harry do feel free
to indulge in a liquorice snack in my
absence, but I have to warn you they're
a little bit sharp.

Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl
and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips
at his hand.

HARRY
Agh!

A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool
of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time
and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore
is seated next to where Harry is.


INT. COURTROOM

HARRY
Professor?

The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.

MAN
Professor.

Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through
Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence.
Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.


BARTY
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request to
present evidence to this counsel. Should
your testimony prove consequential.
Counsel may be prepared to order your
immediate release. Until such time you
remain in the eyes of the ministry a
convicted deatheater. Do you accept
these terms?

IGOR
I do sir.

BARTY
What do you wish to present?

IGOR
I have names sir. There was a Rosier,
Evan Rosier.

BARTY
Mr Rosier is dead.

IGOR
Dead?

MAD-EYE
(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of
me with him though didn't he.

Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.

IGOR
I didn't know.

BARTY
If that is all the witness has to offer...


IGOR
No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a
spy.

BARTY
Augustus Rookwood? Of the department
of ministries.

IGOR
Ya ya, the same. He passed information
to you know who from inside the ministry
itself.

BARTY
Very well. Counsel will deliberate.
In the meantime you will be returned
to Azkaban.

IGOR
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,
Severus Snape.

DUMBLEDORE
The counsel is very much aware you have
given evidence on this matter. Severus
Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior
to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned
spy for us at great personal risk. Today
he's no more a deatheater than I am.


Igor protests loudly.

IGOR
It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful
to the dark lord.

BARTY
Silence!

Barty hits the gavel repeatedly.

BARTY
Unless the witness possesses any name
of genuine consequence this session
is now concluded.

IGOR
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one
more.

BARTY
What's that?

IGOR
The name...

BARTY
Yes?

IGOR
I know for a fact this person took part
in the capture, and by means of the
cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer
Frank Longbottom and...

BARTY
The name! Give me the wretched name!


IGOR
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.

Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,
he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.
Guards seize Barty junior.

BARTY JR
Get your hands off me you pathetic little
men. Hello father.

BARTY
You are no son of mine.

BARTY JR
GAHHHH!

Harry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened
room.

DUMBLEDORE
Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you
should exercise caution. It's a pensieve,
useful if like me you find your mind
a wee bit stretched. It allows me to
see what small things I've already seen.
You see Harry I've searched and searched
for something, some small detail. Something
I might have overlooked, something that
would explain why these terrible things
have happened. Every time I get close
to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.


HARRY
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened
to him?

DUMBLEDORE
He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty
to do it. But he had no choice, the
evidence was overwhelming. Why do you
ask?

HARRY
It's just that I had a dream about him.
It was in the summer, before school.
In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort
was there only he wasn't quite human,
and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's
son.

DUMBLEDORE
Have there been other dreams like this?


HARRY
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these
dreams, what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening do you?

DUMBLEDORE
I think it's unwise for you to linger
over these dreams Harry, I think it's
best that you simply...

Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic
out from his head.

DUMBLEDORE
Cast them away.


INT. CORRIDOR

Harry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the
herbs store.

IGOR
It's a sign Severus, you know what it
means as well as I.

The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.


SNAPE
Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,
your performance in the black lake was
inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?


HARRY
Yes sir.

SNAPE
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,
not something found in your every day
garden. Nor is this, know what it is?


HARRY
Bubble juice sir?

SNAPE
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and
you-know-who himself will spill his
darkest secrets. The use of this on
a student is regrettably forbidden,
however should you ever steal from my
personal stores again, my hand might
just slip over your morning pumpkin
juice.

HARRY
I haven't stolen anything.

SNAPE
Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be
innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing
flies? You and your friends are brewing
polyjuice potion and believe me I'm
going to find out why.

Severus closes the door in Harry's face.


EXT. ARENA

Music is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions
emerge.

DUMBLEDORE
Earlier today Professor Moody placed
the tri-wizards cup deep within the
maze. Only he knows its exact position.
Now as Mr Diggory...

The crowd cheer on hearing his name.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first
position they will be the first to enter
the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

The bulgarian crowd go nuts.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) The first person to touch
the cup will be the winner. I've instructed
the staff to patrol the perimeter, if
at any point should a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task he or she
need only send up red sparks with their
wands. Contestants, gather round.


DUMBLEDORE
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll
find not dragons or creatures of the
deep. Instead you'll face something
more challenging. You see, people change
in the maze. Oh find the cup if you
can, but be very weary you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

MAD-EYE
Champions! Prepare yourselves.

Cedric hugs his father.

DUMBLEDORE
On the count of three... ONE...

The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.
Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.
The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan
out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing
the maze, creature noises are all around.

Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on
him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she
is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's
unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being
swallowed into the undergrowth.

HARRY
Fleur? Fleur!

He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into
the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry
runs. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves
towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.

CEDRIC
Get down!

Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up
and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at
Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.


HARRY
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.

They struggle.

CEDRIC
Get off me!

HARRY
He's bewitched!

The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth
grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric
is pinned down with no means of escape.

CEDRIC
Harry! Harry!

Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps
him up.

CEDRIC
You know for a moment there I thought
you were gonna let it get me.

HARRY
For a moment so did I.

CEDRIC
Some game huh?

HARRY
Some game.

The wind starts blowing again.

CEDRIC
Go. Take it, you saved me!

HARRY
Together, on three. One, two, three!



EXT. GRAVEYARD

Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard.

CEDRIC
You ok?

HARRY
Yeah, you?

CEDRIC
Where are we?

HARRY
I've been here before.

CEDRIC
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.


HARRY
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric,
we have to get back to the cup? Now!


CEDRIC
What are you talking about?

Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.

CEDRIC
What is it?

HARRY
Get back to the cup!

We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.

CEDRIC
Who are you? What do you want?

VOLDEMORT
Kill the spare.

Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.

HARRY
Cedric!

Cedric lays dead on the ground.

Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and
traps him.

VOLDEMORT
Do it, now!

Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on.


WORMTAIL
Bones of the father, unwillingly given.


A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it
into the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.


He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.


He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.
Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops
fall into it.

WORMTAIL
The dark lord shall rise again.

The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.


VOLDEMORT
My wand Wormtail.

Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.

VOLDEMORT
Hold out your arm.

WORMTAIL
Master. Thank you master.

VOLDEMORT
The other arm Wormtail.

Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks
the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been
summoned.

VOLDEMORT
Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's
been, and yet you stand before me as
though it were only yesterday. I confess
myself disappointed, not one of you
tried to find me.

Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.

VOLDEMORT
Not even you, Lucius.

LUCIUS
My lord. Had I detected any sign or
even a whisper of your whereabouts.


VOLDEMORT
There were signs my friend, and more
than whispers.

LUCIUS
I assure you I never renounced the old
ways. The face I have been obliged to
present each day since your absence,
that was my true mask.

WORMTAIL
I returned.

VOLDEMORT
Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you
have proved yourself useful these past
few months Wormtail.

Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.

WORMTAIL
Thank you master, thank you.

VOLDEMORT
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome
boy.

HARRY
Don't touch him.

Harry struggles to get free.

VOLDEMORT
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were
here. Standing on the bones of my father.
I'd introduce you but word has it you're
almost as famous as me these days. The
boy who lived. How lies have fed your
legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really
happened that night thirteen years ago?
Shall I divulge how I truly lost my
powers? It was love. You see when dear
sweet Lily Potter gave her life for
her only son she provided the ultimate
protection. I could not touch you. It
was old magic, something I should have
forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things
have changed, I can touch you now!


Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.

VOLDEMORT
Astonishing what a few drops of your
blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your
wand Potter. I said pick it up, get
up. Get up! You've been taught how to
duel I presume yes? First we bow to
each other. Come on now Harry the niceties
must be observed, Dumbledore would not
want you to forget your manners now
would he? I said bow!

Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.

VOLDEMORT
That's better. And now...

Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.

VOLDEMORT
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be
proud. Especially your filthy mongrel
mother. I'm going to kill you Harry
Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After
tonight no one will ever again question
my powers. After tonight if they speak
of you they'll speak only of how you
begged for death, and I being a merciful
lord obliged. Get up.

Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.


VOLDEMORT
Don't you turn your back on me Harry
Potter I want you to look at me when
I kill you, I want to see the lights
leave your eyes.

Harry takes steps toward Voldemort.

HARRY
Have it your way.

They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.


VOLDEMORT
Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's
mine!

Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's
voice.

HARRY'S DAD
(voice) Harry when the connection is
broken you must get to the portkey.
We can delay it for a moment to give
you time but only a moment, do you understand?


CEDRIC
(voice) Harry take my body back will
you? Take my body back to my father.


HARRY'S MOTHER
(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready.
Let go! Let go!

The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons
the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks
angry.

VOLDEMORT
No!


EXT. ARENA

Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd
don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant
music starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Harry!

Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Tell me what happened!

HARRY
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body
back. I couldn't leave him, not there.


DUMBLEDORE
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's
home, you both are.

FUDGE
Keep everybody in their seats. A boy
has just been killed. The body must
be moved Dumbledore, there are... too
many people.

AMOS
Let me through! That's my son! My boy!


Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.


INT. DARKENED ROOM

Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is
in the room still sobbing. They sit.

MAD-EYE
Are you alright Potter?

Harry nods.

MAD-EYE
Does it hurt?

HARRY
Not so much now.

MAD-EYE
I'd better take a look at it.

We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.

HARRY
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched
it.

MAD-EYE
What was it like? What was he like?


HARRY
Who?

MAD-EYE
The dark lord. What was it like to stand
in his presence?

HARRY
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into
one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.


Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for
his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles
and struggles to find one.

MAD-EYE
Were there others? In the graveyard,
were there others?

HARRY
Um. I don't think I said anything about
a graveyard Professor.

MAD-EYE
Marvellous creatures dragons aren't
they? Do you think that miserable oaf
would have led you into the woods if
I hadn't suggested it? Do you think
Cedric Diggory would have told you to
hold the egg under the water if I hadn't
have told him first myself? Do you think
Neville Longbottom the witless wonder
could have provided you with gilliweed
if I hadn't have given him the book
that led you straight to it? Huh??


HARRY
It was you from the beginning. You put
my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched
Krum. But...

Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.

MAD-EYE
You won because I made it so Potter.
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so. And now
the deed is done. The blood that runs
through these veins runs within the
dark lord. Imagine how he will reward
me when he learns that I have once and
for all silenced the great Harry Potter.


A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.
Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye
by the neck...

DUMBLEDORE
Severus...

Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.


DUMBLEDORE
Do you know who I am?

MAD-EYE
Albus Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?

MAD-EYE
No.

DUMBLEDORE
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?


We see a nod.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry get away from there!

Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains
a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see
that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.


DUMBLEDORE
Are you alright Alastor?

ALASTOR
I'm sorry Albus.

HARRY
That's Moody, but then who's...?

Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.

SNAPE
Polyjuice potion.

DUMBLEDORE
Now we know who's been stealing it from
your store Severus.

Dumbledore looks into the pit.

DUMBLEDORE
We'll get you up in a minute.

Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in
a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.
He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece
which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty
Crouch Junior.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty Crouch Junior.

BARTY JR
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.


Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.


DUMBLEDORE
Your arm Harry.

BARTY JR
You know what this means don't you?
He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.


DUMBLEDORE
Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll
find they're missing a prisoner.


BARTY JR
I'll be welcomed back like a hero.


DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps. Personally I've never had much
time for heroes.


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge
a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory
was as you all know, exceptionally hard
working, intricately fair minded. And
most importantly a fierce fierce friend.
I think therefore you have the right
to know exactly how he died. You see,
Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord
Voldemort. The ministry of magic does
not wish me to tell you this. But not
to do so I think would be an insult
to his memory. Now the pain we all feel
at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds
us that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues,
our hearts beat as one. In light of
recent events the bonds of friendship
we made this year will be more important
than ever. Remember that and Cedric
Diggory will not have died in vain,
you remember that. And we'll celebrate
a boy who was kind and honest and brave
and true right to the very end.


INT. BEDROOM

Harry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.

DUMBLEDORE
I never liked these curtains. Set them
on fire in my fourth year, by accident
of course. I put you in terrible danger
this year Harry I'm sorry.

HARRY
Professor, when I was in the graveyard
there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's
wand and mine sort of connected.

DUMBLEDORE
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents
that night didn't you? They reappeared.


Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry
I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult
times lie ahead. Soon we must all face
the choice between what is right what
is easy. But remember this, you have
friends here. You're not alone.


EXT. HOGWARTS

There's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor
Krum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.

VIKTOR
Write to me. Promise.

HERMIONE
Bye.

Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both
in turn give him a kiss on the head.

FLEUR
Au revoir Ron.

The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The
Durmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.

RON
Do you think we'll ever just have a
quiet year at Hogwarts?

HERMIONE
No.

HARRY
No I don't think so.

HERMIONE
Everything's going to change now isn't
it?

HARRY
Yes.

HERMIONE
Promise you'll write this summer. Both
of you.

RON
Well I won't. You know I won't!

HERMIONE
Harry will won't you?

HARRY
Yeah. Every week.

They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage
head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.
