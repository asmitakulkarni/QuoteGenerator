WIDE HELICOPTER SHOT.  Privet Drive.  CAMERA CRANES DOWN,

NUMBER 4.  HARRY POTTER sits in the window.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Harry pages through a SCRAPBOOK, stops on a MOVING PHOTO
of Ron and Hermione.  SQUAWK!  Harry jumps.  HEDWIG pecks
at the LOCK slung through her cage door, then glowers at
Harry.

HARRY

I can't, Hedwig.  I'm not allowed
to use magic outside of school.
Besides, if Uncle Vernon --

At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.

Har-ry Pot-ter!

UNCLE VERNON (O.S.)

HARRY
Now you've done it.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

While AUNT PETUNIA puts the finishing touches to a
PUDDING of WHIPPED CREAM and SUGARED VIOLETS, UNCLE
VERNON struggles with DUDLEY'S BOW TIE, all the while
glowering at Harry.

UNCLE VERNON
I warned you.  If you can't
control that bloody bird, it'll

HARRY

She's bored.  If I could just let
her out for an hour or two --

UNCLE VERNON
And have you sending secret
messages to your freaky little
friends?  No, sir.

HARRY

But I haven't gotten any messages.
From any of my friends.  Not one.
All summer.

Who'd want to be friends with you?

DUDLEY

UNCLE VERNON

I should think you'd be more
grateful.  We raise you since you
were a baby, give you food off our
table, even let you have Dudley's
second bedroom... purely out of
the goodness of our hearts.

DUDLEY

I thought he got the second
bedroom because Mum was afraid
he'd turn us into dung beetles if
you put him back in the cupboard
under the stairs.

AUNT PETUNIA stops cold, exchanges a dark look with Uncle
Vernon, then sees Dudley extending a finger for the
pudding.

AUNT PETUNIA

Not yet, popkin.  That's for when
the Masons arrive.

UNCLE VERNON

Which should be any moment.  Now.
Let's run through our schedule one
more time.  Petunia, when the
Masons get here, you will be --

AUNT PETUNIA

In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

Good.  And Dudley?

UNCLE VERNON

I'll be waiting to open the door.

DUDLEY

UNCLE VERNON

(turning on Harry)

Excellent.

And you?

I'll be in my bedroom, making no

UNCLE VERNON

Too right you will.  With any
luck, this could well be the day I
make the biggest deal of my
career.

DOORBELL RINGS.  Instantly, Uncle Vernon shoves Harry out
of the kitchen and into the hallway.

Upstairs!  Hurry!

Harry enters, turns, and stops dead:  a tiny CREATURE

Harry Potter!  Such an honor it
is!

HARRY
What... Who are you?

Dobby, sir.  Dobby the house elf.

DOBBY

HARRY

I see.  Not to be rude or
anything, but this isn't a great
time for me to have a house-elf in
my bedroom.

DOBBY

Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands.
It's just that, Dobby has come to
tell you... it is difficult, sir...
Dobby wonders where to begin.

Why don't you sit down?

HARRY

S-s-sit down?

DOBBY

Suddenly Dobby BURSTS INTO TEARS.  LOUD TEARS.  Harry
panics.

HARRY

Shhhh!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean
to offend you or anything --

DOBBY

Offend Dobby!  Dobby has heard of
your greatness, sir, but never has
he been asked to sit down by a
wizard, like an equal...

HARRY

You can't have met many decent
wizards then.

Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the
bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.

Bad Dobby!  Bad Dobby!

Dobby gets back to his feet, wobbling, eyes spinning
dizzily.  Harry regards him with a mixture of concern...
and wariness.

Are you... all right?

HARRY

DOBBY

Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his
family, sir.

Your... family?

HARRY

DOBBY

The wizard family Dobby serves,
sir.  Dobby is bound to serve one
family forever.  If they ever knew
Dobby was here...

Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS urgently.

DOBBY

But Dobby had to come.  Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter.  To warn
him.

(in a fierce whisper)

Harry Potter must not go back to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry this year.

Not go back?  But... I have to.

HARRY

DOBBY

This is a plot.  A plot to make
most terrible things happen.  If
Harry Potter goes back to school
he will be in great danger.

Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.

Too late.  Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts
beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Uncle Vernon is in the midst of telling a joke.

UNCLE VERNON

They arrive at the ninth hole
and!--

DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing out from above.

MR. MASON

dragged something in with it,
Dursley.

Not to worry.  I'll sort it out.

Harry wrestles the lamp away from Dobby.

Stop!  Stop!

HARRY

FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing.  Quickly, Harry grabs
Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the
wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.

UNCLE VERNON

What the devil are you doing up
here!  You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer
joke.  One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!

He stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR.
Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe.

See why I've got to go back?  I

DOBBY

Friends who don't even write to
Harry Potter?

HARRY

Well, I expect they've been --
hang on, how do you know my
friends haven't been writing me?

Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.

DOBBY

Harry Potter mustn't be angry with
Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry
Potter thought his friends had
forgotten him... Harry Potter
might not want to go back to
school, sir...

HARRY
Give me those.  Now.

Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door.
Panicking...

... Harry flies desperately after, Dobby bouncing like a
ping-pong ball down the stairs and into the kitchen.  As
Harry races in, he finds Dobby on the counter, waving his
arms.  Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding RISES,
then floats into the living room, HOVERING over the
Mason's heads. The Masons don't see, but the Dursleys --
goggle-eyed--do.

Dobby... Please... No...

HARRY

DOBBY

Harry Potter must say he's not
going back to school.

I can't.  Hogwarts is my home.

Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS.  The pudding PLUMMETS...
straight onto the Masons.  They stand blinking, covered
head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets.  The
Masons exit.  Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after
them.

UNCLE VERNON

I'm sorry.  It's our nephew.  Very
disturbed.  Meeting strangers
upsets him, so we kept him

The Masons RACE out of the house, the Dursleys FOLLOWING.

We have ice cream...

AUNT PETUNIA

The Masons get into their car and drive off, just as a
SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky.  An OWL SWOOPS down, and
DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's feet.  He picks up the
letter, opens it.  As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in
Uncle Vernon's eye.  He turns and races back inside the
house.  Aunt Petunia follows.

Uncle Vernon runs back into the living room, extends the

EXT./INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

A SHORT MONTAGE BEGINS:

Uncle Vernon fits IRON BARS to the inside of Harry's
window.

Drills a METAL FLAP to the base of the bedroom door.

Fits a FAT, GREY LOCK to the door itself.  Soaking with
sweat, he casts Harry a nasty grin and pulls shut the
DOOR.  It closes with the DULL CLANK of a cell.

13

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Harry stares gloomily out the window.  The METAL FLAP
RATTLES and Dudley's pudgy hand slides a BOWL of TINNED
SOUP onto the floor.  He grins cruelly through the
opening.

I know what day it is.

DUDLEY

HARRY

Well done, Dudley.  Finally

you.

DUDLEY

Today's your birthday.  And nobody

Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap.  Harry sighs, takes the soup
and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig.

It's no good turning your beak up.
It's all we've got.

An OLD, TURQUOISE-COLORED FORD ANGLIA floats in midair.
Ron leans out the back window.  His brother FRED sits in

passenger seat.

HARRY

Fred?  George?  What're you doing

RON

Rescuing you, of course.  Where's
your trunk?

Stuffed with clothes, spellbooks.  The trunk CLOSES, SNAPS

Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto
the ledge, when... BAM!  The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.

Petunia!  He's getting away!

UNCLE VERNON

As Harry leaps for the windowsill, Uncle Vernon CHARGES
FORWARD and SNATCHES his ankle.  Harry tumbles into the
darkness, one hand gripping Hedwig's cage, the other
reaching out and... CATCHING Ron's at the last possible
second.

Uncle Vernon puts both hands to Harry's ankle, pulls
harder.  Ron braces himself, pulls back.  Harry hangs,
stretched high over the lawn, directly above the mangled
steel bars.

CLOSEUP:  Harry's hand begins to slip from Ron's fingers.

INSIDE OF CAGE:  Hedwig PECKS feverishly at the LOCK.

CLOSE-UP:  Ron.  PANICKED.

Hold on, Harry!

UNCLE VERNON

Oh no, boy!  You and that bloody
pigeon aren't going anywhere!

CLOSE-UP:  Harry's hand begins to slip away from Ron's.

Hedwig SWOOPS into the sky, WHEELS BACK and hammers her

As the Anglia drops through a pink sky, a haphazard mess
of a HOUSE, built around a towering central chimney,
appears below.  By the road, a lopsided SIGN reads:  THE
BURROW.  FLUMPH!  The car touches down in a WHIRLING CONE
of dust, scatters a group of chickens, and fishtails to a
halt.  The boys spill quickly out of the car.  FRED
WHISPERS urgently.

FRED

Hurry!  Let's nip inside before
Mum wakes up!

INT. FRONT ROOM - THE BURROW - MOMENTS LATER

The boys sneak inside, gently close the door.  Harry
stops.  Magical objects surround him:  A CLOCK displays
different chores for each family member.  A pair of
NEEDLES knit a sweater by themselves.  And a stack of
PLAYING CARDS that.  A stack of PLAYING CARDS SHUFFLE
themselves, providing a cooling breeze for Ron's aging
rat, SCABBERS.  Ron shrugs, averts his eyes self-
consciously.

It's not much.

RON

I think it's... brilliant!

HARRY

Ron looks up.  Sees Harry's mesmerized face.  Slowly...
GRINS.

WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?!

A small, RED-HEADED GIRL appears.  Sees Harry.  And...

Well now.  Who are you?

MR. WEASLEY

RON

MR. WEASLEY

Good Lord, are you really?  Ron's
told us all about you, of course.
When did you get here?

This morning.  Your sons flew that
enchanted car of yours to Surrey
house and back last night.

Did you now!  How'd it go?!

MR. WEASLEY

 wife's eye)

I... I mean... That was very
wrong, boys.  Very wrong indeed.
So, Harry.  You must know all
about Muggles.  Tell me, what
exactly is the function of a
parking meter?

Harry is about to answer, when he notices an OWL (ERROL)
soaring toward the kitchen window.  To Harry's horror,
the owl doesn't pull up.  It just flies... SMACK!... into
the glass.

MRS. WEASLEY

That must be Errol with the post.
Fetch him, will you, George?

George takes the unconscious Errol, absently lays him on
a draining board, and takes the LETTERS clutched in his
claws.

when a WITHERED HAND in a GLASS CASE catches his eye:
The Hand of Glory.  Nearby, an OPAL NECKLACE gleams:
Caution:  Do not touch.  Cursed--Has Claimed the Lives of
Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.  Oddly transfixed by it
all, Harry drifts toward the exit, when...

DRACO MALFOY and his father, LUCIUS MALFOY, appear beyond

about, spies a LARGE BLACK CABINET and slips inside.  As
he pulls the doors closed, a TINY CARD swings INTO VIEW:
Crushing Cabinet.

Malfoy and his father enter.  A stooped man (MR. BORGIN)
emerges from the back room.  IN THE CABINET, Harry
watches, unaware that the walls around him are... SLOWLY
CLOSING IN.

MR. BORGIN

Mr. Malfoy!  What a pleasure to
see you again.  If I may, just in
today --

LUCIUS MALFOY

I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin.
But selling.

Selling?

MR. BORGIN

LUCIUS MALFOY

You have heard, of course, that
the Ministry of Magic is
conducting more raids.  There are
even rumors of a new Muggle
Protection Act...

Lucius unravels a roll of parchment, hands it to Borgin.

LUCIUS MALFOY

I have a few... ah... items at
home that might prove embarrassing
if the Ministry were to call.
Certain poisons and the like...

Hmmm... yes.  I see...

MR. BORGIN

INSIDE THE CABINET, Harry realizes the walls are CLOSING
IN.  His eyes shift upward.  The ceiling is DROPPING.

Draco drifts to the Hand of Glory, reaches out, when...
the HAND GRABS HIM.  Draco shrieks, manages to slip free,
then calms.  He eyes the hand with malicious glee.

Can I have this?

Ah, the Hand of Glory.  Insert a

Hopefully my son will amount to
more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
Though if his marks don't pick
up --

DRACO

It's not my fault the teachers
have favorites.  That Hermione
Granger --

LUCIUS MALFOY

I would have thought you'd be
ashamed that a girl of no
wizarding family beat you in every
exam.

It's the same all over.  Wizard
blood is counting for less

Not with me.

Borgin checks off one last time, then returns the
parchment to Lucius.  Satisfied, Malfoy nods.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Very good.  I'll expect you at the
manor tomorrow.  Come, Draco.

They exit.  As Borgin slips into the back room, the
Crushing Cabinet's doors FLY OPEN and Harry leaps free.
Inside, the walls, floor, and ceiling SNAP SHUT!  Borgin
reappears, blinks curiously at Harry, then watches him
RACE out the door.

Hello, Hagrid.  Oh, it's wonderful

Oculus Reparo.

HERMIONE

Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.

I need to remember that one.

HARRY

C'mon.  Everyone's been so worried.

HERMIONE

Hermione leads them to Gringotts, where Hermione's rather
nervous-looking Muggle parents stand with the Weasleys.

MR. WEASLEY

So you're dentists!  Fascinating!
I understand other Muggles quite
fear you?  Why is that?

MRS. WEASLEY

Oh, Harry.  Thank goodness.  We
hoped you'd only gone one grate
too far.  Come now.  We're off to
Flourish and Blotts.

HERMIONE

Isn't it thrilling!  Gilderoy
Lockhart's going to be there!  We

Harry and the others thread their way through a

books at the rear of the shop.  At the sight of him, Mrs.
Weasley pats her hair.

There he is!

Mum fancies him.

For this, Mrs. Weasley gives Ron a jab in the shoulder.
A SHORT MAN WITH A CAMERA bumps past.

SHORT MAN

Out of the way!  This is for The

Instantly, Lockhart looks up, flashes a smile, when...

It can't be Harry Potter?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

The crowd WHISPERS excitedly as Lockhart dives forward,
seizes Harry's hand and turns him toward the
photographer.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(under his breath)

Nice big smile, Harry.  Together,
you and I rate the front page.
(as the CAMERA FLASHES)
Ladies and gentlemen!  What an
extraordinary moment this is!
When young Harry here stepped into
Flourish and Blotts this morning
to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me -- which, incidentally
is celebrating its twenty-seventh
week atop The Daily Prophet's
Bestseller List -- he had no idea
that he would, in fact, be leaving

Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red
with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's
cauldron.

Silence, Draco!  Ah... Mr. Potter.
I don't believe we've met.

Lucius Malfoy extends his hand, as if offering to shake
Harry's, but instead gently plays his fingers over the
fringe of Harry's scalp, revealing Harry's LIGHTNING BOLT
SCAR.  At his touch, Harry withdraws, ever so slightly.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Forgive me, Mr. Potter.  But your
scar is legend.  As, of course, is
the wizard who gave it to you.

HARRY
He was a murderer.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Yes, a pity about your parents.
Curious that you yourself should
escape with a mere flesh wound.
Curious, too, that you speak of
him in the past.  Surely, you
don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named is gone forever.

His name is Voldemort.

HARRY

Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word.

LUCIUS MALFOY
You must be very brave, Mr.
Potter, to dare speak his name.
Or foolish.

HERMIONE

Fear of a name only increases fear
of the thing itself.

Lucius Malfoy's eyes slide, find Hermione staring
defiantly.

LUCIUS MALFOY

You must be Miss Granger.  Draco's
told me all about you... and your
parents.  Muggles, aren't you?

Mr. and Mrs. Granger nod nervously.  Lucius Malfoy can

LUCIUS MALFOY

Busy time at the Ministry.  All

Malfoy reaches into Ginny's cauldron, removes a very old,
battered copy of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Obviously not.  Dear me.  What's
the use of being a disgrace to the
name of wizard if they don't even
pay you well for it.

MR. WEASLEY

We have a very different idea
about what disgraces the name of
wizard, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY

(glancing at the
 Grangers)

Clearly.  The company you keep,
Weasley.  And I thought your
family could sink no lower.

Mr. Weasley moves to hit Lucius Malfoy.  Hagrid steps
forward, puts a firm hand on Mr. Weasley's shoulder.

HAGRID
Ignore 'im, Arthur.

Mr. Weasley backs away.  Lucius Malfoy tosses Ginny's
BATTERED TEXTBOOK back into her cauldron.

Harry nods, not entirely convinced.  He peers out the

the silver button.

RON

CAMERA ZOOMS ALONG the ridge of a cliff.  The
car reappears from above, gliding away FROM CAMERA.

Any sign of the train?

RON

There!  Up ahead!  Look...

HARRY

Along a STEEP BRIDGE, a single line of TRAIN TRACKS
appear.

Brilliant.

RON

Ron SHIFTS, GLIDES DOWN, until the Anglia is only a few
feet above the tracks.  The boys peer ahead, looking for

RON

It must be around here

Behind them, through the Anglia's rear window, the
Hogwarts Express APPEARS, closing fast.  Harry and Ron
perk up.  Smile.

Then, at precisely the same moment, Harry and Ron
register the DIRECTION of the sound.  They glance at each
other, turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the
rear window.

glimpses NEVILLE and SEAMUS, mouths open in astonishment.

Harry's grips Ron's hand, eyes the train steaming far

Before Harry can respond, the tree begins to PUMMEL THE
CAR from all sides, tossing Henry and Ron about like
popcorn.  WINDOWS SHATTER.  Heavy DENTS appear on the
roof above Ron and Harry's heads.  Then the car FALLS
again...

... SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND.  Instantly, the
tree's lower branches shoot through the front and rear
windscreens and, gaining purchase, begin to SHAKE THE CAR
BACK AND FORTH.

The tree PITCHES the car into the air.  As the Anglia
SLAMS DOWN again, bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS, the
ENGINE BURBLES BACK TO LIFE.  Harry LOOKS UP, peering
through the shattered windscreen.  The willow's branches,
as one, rear back, ready for one last punishing blow.
Harry CRIES OUT.

Reverse!  Reverse!

Ron SHIFTS, the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS, and the willow
PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated.
Safely clear, the doors fly open, the seats tip sideways,
and Ron and Harry are ejected.  As they hit the ground,
their trunks fly from the boot, Hedwig's cage rockets out
the back window, and Hedwig herself flaps into the night.
Taillights blazing angrily, the BATTERED car speeds off,

Excellent.  Ten points to

my own range of hair care potions.
Good girl.

Hermione beams.  Lockhart's expression suddenly darkens.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Now... be warned!  It is my job to
arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind!
You may find yourself facing your
own worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall
you whilst I am here...

With a showman's flair, Lockhart turns slowly to the cage.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I must ask you not to scream.  It
might provoke them.

A pale Neville draws back.  Harry and Ron lean forward.
Lockhart lets the tension build, then WHIPS off the
cover.  Inside the cage are several electric blue
CREATURES.  Eight inches tall, with pointed faces and
wings, they rattle the bars and pull bizarre faces at the
students.

Cornish pixies?

SEAMUS

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

Unable to control himself, Seamus SNORTS with laughter.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan,
but pixies can be devilishly
tricky little blighters.  Let's
see what you make of them now!

Lockhart flings open the cage.  Instantly, the pixies
rocket about, spraying the students with ink bottles,
BREAKING BEAKERS and shredding books.  Two SEIZE Neville
by the ears, lift him into the air, and begin to circle
the ceiling.

The spell has absolutely no effect.  A particularly
obnoxious pixie makes a face, seizes Lockhart's wand and
tosses it out the window.  Lockhart joins the stampede to
the door.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

I'll ask you three to just nip the
rest of them back into their cage.

SLAMMING the door, he's gone.  Harry, Ron and Hermione
stand blinking.  Ron swats a pixie gnawing his ear.

RON

WOOD

'I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team
permission to practice today,
owing to the need to train their

You've got a new Seeker?  Who?

A pasty-faced boy pushes to the front.  It's... Malfoy.

Draco?

HARRY

DRACO

That's right.  And that's not all

As one, the seven Slytherins hold out seven brand-new
GLEAMING BROOMSTICKS.  The Gryffindors look stunned.

Those are Nimbus Two Thousand

FLINT

A generous gift from Draco's

DRACO

That's right, Weasley.  You see,

You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!

Eat slugs!

Ron points his cracked wand at Malfoy.  PFFT! -- a BOLT
of GREEN LIGHT scissors out the wrong end, hitting Ron
himself in the stomach.  As he drops to the grass,
Hermione runs to him

Ron!  Say something!

HERMIONE

Ron opens his mouth and... BELCHES.  Hermione draws back,
and watches a TRIO of SLUGS dribble out his mouth.  The
Slytherins CROW with LAUGHTER.  Angrily, Ron rises, only
to BELCH again.  Fascinated, Colin Creevey runs up with
his camera.

COLIN

HERMIONE

He called me a Mudblood.

He didn'!

HAGRID

Harry looks confused.  Hermione glances at him, then
away, obviously pained by this.

HERMIONE

It means dirty blood.  Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who
was Muggle-born.  Someone with
non-magic parents.  Someone...
like me.  It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized
conversation.

HAGRID

Yeh see, Harry.  There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family --
who think they're better than
everyone else 'cause they're what
people call pureblood.

That's horrible.

HARRY

Dirty blood.  There's 'ardly a

That's Filch's cat.  Mrs. Norris.

HARRY

The cat hangs stiffly by her tail from a torch bracket,
eyes open and blank.  Harry's eyes shift to the adjacent
WINDOW:  near the topmost pane, SPIDERS scuttle up a
silvery thread, fight to get through a crack in the
glass.

HERMIONE

Look at that.  Have you ever seen
spiders act like that?  Ron...?

 Hermione)

Everyone except you three.

As the corridor empties, Dumbledore steps to the wall
and, with extreme gentleness, removes Mrs. Norris.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
It was definitely a curse that
killed her -- probably the
Transmogrifian Torture.
Encountered it myself once, in
Ouagadougou.  The full story's in

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONT'D)

Godric Gryffindor, Helga
Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and
Salazar Slytherin.  Three of the
founders co-existed quite
harmoniously.  One did not.

RON
Three glasses who?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts.  He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.
In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

(a beat)

According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets.  Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school.  The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic.

Muggle-borns.

HERMIONE

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Yes.  Naturally, the school has been
searched many times for such a
chamber.  It has never been found.

HERMIONE

Professor, what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?

The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control.  It is said to be

sits next to Snape.

Harry circles high above the pitch, searching for the
Golden Snitch.  Suddenly, Malfoy streaks by overhead.

BLUDGER drops INTO FRAME, begins to streak toward his
head.

toward Harry and the Bludger, when... Hermione's hand
intercedes.  She glances knowingly at his fractured wand.

Harry glances at Malfoy's sneering face.  BUZZING inches
above Malfoy's left ear is... the GOLDEN SNITCH.  Harry
CHARGES.  Malfoy GULPS, swings clear, and watches Harry
rocket past.

As Harry chases the plummeting Snitch, Malfoy FOLLOWS IN
HOT PURSUIT.  They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing the HISSING
SNITCH deep into the TRENCH circling the pitch.  Shoulder
to shoulder, they RACE MADLY, driving and dodging the
wooden support beams that crisscross their path.
Directly behind them, the Bludger FOLLOWS, SHATTERING the
BEAMS as it dogs Harry.

Malfoy KICKS Harry, forcing him to the edge of the
trench.  Harry BRUSHES the wall, battling for control.
Malfoy turns, SNICKERS, then looks back... and finds
himself heading smack into a wooden beam.  Panicked, he
tries to pull up.  Too late.  Broom meets beam and Malfoy
spirals out of the trench and -- THWUMP! -- flat on his
back in the middle of the pitch.

acrobatic move, SNATCHES the Snitch out of the air with
his good hand.  Unable to control his broom with his
shattered arm, he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD.

Wincing, Harry rolls onto his shoulders, SQUINTS UP:  a
BLACK DOT -- growing rapidly LARGER -- is plummeting from
the sky, directly toward him.  It's... the rogue Bludger.
Instantly, Harry spins away, grimacing in agony, as the
Bludger...

... hits the ground like a SLEDGE HAMMER, violently
TATTOOING the pitch again and again, only inches from
Harry.  Calmly, Hermione strides forth, points her wand.

Finite Incantatem!

The Bludger hangs briefly in the air.  Slowly ceases
spinning.  Drops heavily to the pitch.  Harry exhales,
relieved, only to recall the searing pain in his arm.  As
CONCERNED FACES swim above him, one particular face
pushes through the others:

Lockhart TWIRLS his WAND, Harry braces himself, and...
nothing.  He blinks, looks up:  the faces -- which now
include Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid -- look horror-
stricken.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Ah.  Yes.  Well, that can
sometimes happen.  The point is,
the bones are no longer broken.

HAGRID

Brok'n?  He doesn't 'ave any bones
at all!

Harry looks:  his arm looks like an empty rubber glove.

INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY

A dazed Malfoy slumps out with Crabbe and Goyle.  Ron,
standing by Harry's bed with Hermione, grins, then
watches MADAM POMFREY pour out a STEAMING BEAKERFUL OF
LIQUID from a bottle of SKELE-GRO.  A group of
Gryffindors, including some of his teammates, stand
nearby.

MADAM POMFREY
He should have been brought
straight to me!  I can mend bones
in a heartbeat -- but growing them
back --

You will be able to, won't you?

HERMIONE

MADAM POMFREY

I'll be able to, certainly, but it
will be painful.  You're in for a
rough night, Potter.  Regrowing
bones is nasty business.

Harry takes the steaming cup and drinks.  Grimaces.

MADAM POMFREY
Well, what did you expect --
pumpkin juice?

FLASH!  Harry blinks, sees Colin Creevey standing there.

lattice-work of moonlight that burns softly on the walls

BACK TO SCENE

He SENSES something... a presence... when...

Five BANDAGED FINGERS ENTER FRAME, begin to SPONGE his
brow.  Harry bolts upright, finds...

Dobby!

HARRY

DOBBY

Harry Potter came back to school.
Dobby warned him.  Harry Potter
should have listened to Dobby.
Harry Potter should have gone back
home when he missed the train.

HARRY

(pushing the sponge
 away)

It was you!  You stopped the
barrier from letting Ron and me
through!

DOBBY

Indeed yes, sir.  Dobby hid and
watched for Harry Potter and
sealed the gateway.

Dobby had to iron his hands...

HARRY

You'd better clear off before my
bones come back, Dobby, or I might
strangle you!

DOBBY

(smiling weakly)

Dobby is used to death threats,
sir.  Dobby gets them five times a
day at home.

HARRY

I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

DOBBY

Not kill you, sir, never kill you!
Dobby remembers how it was before
Harry Potter triumphed over He Who
Must Not Be Named.  We house elves
were treated like vermin, sir.  Of
course, Dobby is still treated
like vermin...

Dobby HONKS his nose on the filthy pillowcase he wears.

Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

HARRY

DOBBY

This, sir?  'Tis a mark of the
house elf's enslavement.  Dobby
can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.  The
family is careful not to pass
Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for
then he would be free to leave
their house forever.

Dobby's ears QUIVER, detecting... FOOTSTEPS.  He
WHISPERS.

happen before?  Who's doing it
now?

DOBBY

Dobby cannot say, sir.  Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe.

No, Dobby!  Tell me!  Who is it?

HARRY

CRACK!  Dobby is gone.  SHADOWS flicker beyond the
CURTAIN encircling Harry's bed.  Harry slumps down...
peers through a slit in the curtains.  Dumbledore, in a
nightcap, and McGonagall, in a tartan robe, heave a SMALL
STATUE onto an empty bed.  Seconds later, Madam Pomfrey
bustles in.

What's happened?

MADAM POMFREY

There's been another attack.

DUMBLEDORE

Madam Pomfrey GASPS.  It is not a statue lying there.  It
is Colin Creevey, CAMERA still clutched to his eye.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Perhaps he managed to get a
picture of his attacker...

Dumbledore opens the camera.  A JET OF STEAM HISSES
forth.

What does this mean, Albus?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

DUMBLEDORE

It means our students are in great
danger, Minerva.  Mr. Creevey was
fortunate.  If not for this...

BUBBLING CAULDRON, as Hermione adds STRANGE INGREDIENTS.

HERMIONE

Again?  You mean, the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?

RON

Of course!  Don't you see?  Lucius
Malfoy must've opened it when he
was at school here, and now he's
told Draco how to do it.

HERMIONE

Maybe.  We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

RON

Enlighten me.  Why are we
brewing this potion in broad
daylight, in the middle of a
girls' lavatory?  Don't you think
we'll get caught?

Never.  No one over comes in here.

There is a LOUD, PIERCING SCREECH, and the GHOST OF A

NOTICE-BOARD:  DUELING CLUB!  First Meeting Tonight.  A
GOLDEN STAGE has been erected.  Lockhart struts atop it.
Harry, Ron, Hermione and good number of other students
watch.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Gather round!  Gather round!  Can
everyone see me? Can you all hear
me?  Excellent.  In light of the
dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted
me permission to start this little
Dueling Club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for full
details, see my published works.

The boy next to Harry, JUSTIN-FINCH FLETCHLEY, turns to
him.

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY

That Lockhart's something, isn't
he?  Awfully brave chap.

(offering his hand)

Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Hufflepuff.

Nice to meet you.  I'm --

HARRY

JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY

I know who you are.  We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns.

Justin grins agreeably, looks back to the stage, where
Professor Snape has joined Lockhart.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape.  He has
sportingly agreed to help me with
a short demonstration.  Now I
don't want any of you youngsters
to worry.  You'll still have your
Potions Master when I'm through
with him, never fear!

What's the fun in that?

Lockhart and Snape face each other and bow.  They turn,
walk ten paces, then... SPIN... wands poised like swords.

kill, of course.

HARRY

(eyeing Snape)
I wouldn't bet on that.

One-two-three --

A dazzling flash of SCARLET LIGHT bursts forth and BLASTS
Lockhart off his feet and into the wall behind.

Do you think he's all right?

HERMIONE

Who cares?

HARRY/RON

GILDEROY LOCKHART

(rising unsteadily)

Well, there you have it.  That was
a Disarming Charm.  As you see,
I've lost my wand.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
(as Hermione returns it)

Ah, thank you, Miss Granger.  Yes,
an excellent idea to show them
that, Professor Snape, but if you
don't mind my saying so, it was
very obvious what you were about
to do.  If I had wanted to stop
you it would have been only too
easy...

SNAPE

Perhaps it would be prudent to
first teach the students to block
unfriendly spells, Professor.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

An excellent suggestion, Professor
Snape.  Let's have a volunteer
pair.  Potter, Weasley, how about
you?

SNAPE

Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.  We'll
be sending Potter to the hospital
wing in a matchbox.  Might I
suggest someone from my own house.
Malfoy, perhaps.

Malfoy and Harry eye each other malevolently as they take
their places onstage.  Grudgingly, they bow to each
other.

Scared, Potter?

DRACO

You wish.

HARRY

They turn, walk ten paces, then WHIRL, wands poised.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Wands at the ready!  When I count
to three, cast your charms to
disarm your opponent -- only to
disarm.  We don't want any
accidents.  One, two --

Malfoy FIRES early, knocking Harry off his feet with a
BLAST of WHITE LIGHT.  He jumps up, points his wand.

Rictusempra!

HARRY

A jet of SILVER LIGHT hits Malfoy dead in the stomach.
He doubles up, WHEEZING.

I said disarm only!

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Serpensortia!

To Harry's horror, the tip of Malfoy's wand EXPLODES and
a LONG BLACK SNAKE SLITHERS forth.  Snape smiles with
amusement.

Don't move, Potter.  I'll get rid

Allow me!

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Lockhart flicks his wand.   BANG!  The SNAKE flies into
the air, HISSES in rage, and slithers straight towards
Justin Finch-Fletchley.  As students SCREAM, Harry --
oddly calm -- approaches the snake.  It rises, fangs
exposed, poised to strike Justin.

HARRY

(in Parseltongue)

Leave him!

The snake looks into Harry's eyes, then turns for Justin.

HARRY

(in Parseltongue)

LEAVE HIM!

The snake hovers a moment more, then -- miraculously --
slumps to the floor.  Harry blinks, as if coming out of a
trance, grins curiously at the snake, and offers his hand
to Justin.

What are you playing at?

JUSTIN-FINCH-FLETCHLEY

Terrified, Justin backs away.  Confused, Harry eyes the
faces around him.  Malfoy looks shocked.  Seamus and
Neville's eyes glitter with fear.  Ginny bolts the room.
Snape waves his wand and the snake VANISHES in PUFF OF
BLACK SMOKE, then regards Harry with a look that is both
shrewd and calculating.

RON

(taking Harry's arm)

Come on.  Move.  Now.

Ron and Hermione usher Harry inside.  Harry glances up,

dormitory.

you tell us?

at the zoo once.  But so what?  I
bet loads of people here can do
it.

HERMIONE

No.  They can't.  It's not a very
common gift, Harry.  This is bad.

HARRY

What's bad?  If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin --

Oh, that's what you said to it.

RON

You were there!  You heard me!

HARRY

RON

I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

HARRY

I spoke a different language?  But
I didn't realize -- how can I
speak a language without knowing I
can?

HERMIONE

I don't know, Harry.  But it
sounded like you were egging the
snake on or something.  It was...
creepy.

As Gryffindors stream into the room, they eye Harry
warily.  Even Seamus, Neville, and Dean Thomas walk by
without a word.

HERMIONE

Harry, listen out me.  There's a
reason the symbol of Slytherin
house is a serpent.  Salazar
Slytherin was a Parselmouth.  He
could talk to snakes too.

He smiles at Harry, then, seconds later, Hermione does
the same -- something forced about it all.  Unable to
bear it, Harry gathers his books, gets up from the table.

As Harry walks, students glance up, meet his gaze, then
look away.  Even MADAM PINCE eyes him from her desk.
Ginny Weasley, tired and pale, scribbles furiously in a
SMALL BLACK BOOK.

Harry exits, walks into the hallway and pauses.  From
inside a room, the VOICES of a group of Hufflepuffs can
be heard.

ERNIE

So, anyway, I told Justin to hide
up in our dormitory.  I mean to
say, if Potter's marked him down
as his next victim, it's best he
keep a low profile for a while.

Justin?

ERNIE

Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.
Everyone knows that's the mark of
a dark wizard.  Have you ever
heard of a decent one who could
talk to snakes?  They called
Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.

(whispering darkly)

Remember what was written on the
wall:  Enemies of the Heir Beware.
Potter had some sort of run-in
with Filch.  Next thing we know,
Filch's cat's attacked.  That
first-year Creevey's been annoying
Potter.  Then Creevey's attacked.

HANNAH

He always seems so nice, though.
And, after all, he is the one who
made You Know Who disappear.

ERNIE

That's probably why You Know Who
wanted to kill him in the first
place.  Didn't want another Dark
Lord competing with him.

Harry doesn't need to hear anymore.  He slips quietly
away.

FLICKERING TORCH, something DARK lies.  A WINDOWPANE
RATTLES in the WIND and the torch... goes out.  Harry
steps closer, finds...

Justin-Finch-Fletchley.  Lying rigid on the floor, a look
of shock on his frozen face.  Nearby, an inert Nearly
Headless Nick floats, body teeming with BLACK SMOKE.
Kneeling, Harry notices a TRAIL OF SPIDERS scuttling away
from Justin's body and out the loose windowpane... when
suddenly...

... Harry senses someone watching him, wheels:
McGonagall.

Professor, I swear I didnât --

HARRY

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

This is out of my hands, Potter.
Mr. Filch, will you take care of
this, please?

Harry's eyes shift.  Filch lurks in the shadows beyond
McGonagall.  He steps forward, HISSES QUIETLY.

FILCH

Caught in the act.  I'll have you
out this time, Potter.  Mark my
words...

Gargoyle's wings close.  Harry rises to an upper floor.

Harry steps out of the Gargoyle's embrace and enters a
large, circular room.  STRANGE SILVER INSTRUMENTS WHIR
quietly.  On a nearby shelf, the SORTING HAT sits.  Harry
casts a wary eye at the PAST HEADMASTERS snoozing in the
PORTRAITS around him.  In the last portrait, the
Headmaster is awake, reading a book.  He is PROFESSOR
DIPPET.  Harry approaches the Sorting Hat, glances
around, then places it atop his head.

Harry strips the hat off, tosses it back onto the shelf.

You're wrong!

HARRY

The hat sits motionless.  Silent.  Hearing a GAGGING
SOUND, Harry wheels, finds an OLD, DECREPIT BIRD (FAWKES)
sitting on a GOLDEN PERCH.  It wobbles, then... BURSTS
INTO FLAMES.  As Dumbledore enters, Harry looks horror-
struck.

HARRY

Professor, your bird... I couldn't
do anything... He just caught
fire.

DUMBLEDORE

About time too.  He's been looking
dreadful for days.  Pity you had
to see him on a Burning Day.  He's
really very handsome most of the
time.

(off Harry's look)
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
Phoenixes burst into flame when it
is time for them to die and are
reborn from the ashes.

Harry looks to the floor.  The ASHES swirl.  A baby
Fawkes pokes out his wrinkled head, blinking through the
dust.

DUMBLEDORE

Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy
loads, their tears have healing
powers, and they make highly
faithful pets.

Just then, Hagrid -- still clutching the dead rooster --

CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Harry and Ron have changed into the
Slytherin robes.  All three raise their glasses.  Drop
the hairs.  The potion turns shades of YELLOW, BROWN, and
KHAKI.

Ugh.  Essence of Crabbe...

RON

They nod.  DRINK.  Ron swallows grimly, doubles over.

Think I'm gonna be sick...

RON

He runs into a stall.  Harry looks sick, steps to a
CRACKED MIRROR.  Hermione pauses.  Looks worried.
Something's wrong...

INSIDE THE STALL:  Ron bends over the toilet, watches his
reflection morph into Crabbe.

IN THE CRACKED MIRROR:  Harry watches his face contort
into the thick features of Goyle.

Hermione looks at her arm.  Patches of fur begin to
spread across her wrist and hand.  Terrified, she RUNS
into a stall.

Ron emerges from his stall, a dead ringer for Crabbe.

DRACO

'Arthur Weasley, Head of the
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office,
was today fined fifty Galleons for
bewitching a Muggle car.  "Weasley
has brought the Ministry into
disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a
governor of Hogwarts.  "He is
clearly unfit to draw up our laws
and his ridiculous Muggle
Protection Act should be scrapped
immediately."'

Grinning, Malfoy glances over the paper at Harry and Ron.

DRACO

Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so
much he should snap his wand in
half and go join them.  You'd
never know the Weasleys were
purebloods, the way they behave.
Embarrassment to the wizarding

Well, go to the hospital wing

surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't
reported all these attacks yet.  I
suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush
it all up.  He'll be sacked if it
doesnât stop soon.  Father always
said Dumbledore's the worst thing
that's ever happened to this place.

You're wrong!

HARRY

DRACO

What?  Did you say that I was
wrong?  You think there's someone
here who's worse than Dumbledore?

Ron stiffens.  Worried.  Harry thinks, then:

Harry Potter.

HARRY

DRACO
(grinning)

Good one, Goyle.  You're
absolutely right.  Saint Potter.
He's another one with no proper
wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go
around with that Mudblood Granger.
And people actually think he's the
Heir of Slytherin.

Harry and Ron exchange a glance.  Harry leans closer to
Draco.

HARRY

Then you must have some idea who's
behind it all?

DRACO

You know I haven't, Goyle.  How
many times do I have to tell you?
But my father did say this much:
It's been fifty years since the
Chamber was opened.  He wouldn't
tell me who opened it -- only that
they were expelled -- but I know
this:  the last time the Chamber
of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood
died.

You're acting very... odd.

Harry turns, sees Ron staring wide-eyed:  Harry's SCAR is

Ron freezes, terrified, when... Harry grins, ending the

dashes off.

HARRY

Ginny!  I was only joking --
Brilliant.  Even your sister

Of course!  The night I had

Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,

possible he knew where the Chamber
was, how to open it, even what
sort of creature lives in it.  If
so, whoever's behind the attacks
this time wouldn't want a diary
like this lying around, would
they?

That's a brilliant theory,
Hermione.  With just one tiny
little flaw.  There's nothing
written in this diary.

does, a DROP of INK hangs, suspended like a tear, then...
DROPS.

The ink BLAZES briefly, then... VANISHES... as if it were
sucked into the page.  Excited, Harry dips his quill
again, and, this time, writes:  My name is Harry Potter.

The words blaze, VANISH.  Slowly, oozing out of the page,
comes a response:  Hello, Harry Potter.  My name is Tom

corner.  A FLURRY of SHADOWS dances on the wall beyond
the boy, revealing the presence of others, unseen, in an
adjoining room.

As Harry advances, LOW VOICES emanate from the shadows.
As he reaches the boy, Harry speaks in a WHISPER:

Excuse me.  Could you tell me

She holds up a SMALL CIRCULAR MIRROR.  Harry shakes his
head.  McGonagall nods gravely, leads them out.  As they
go, the CAMERA DRIFTS to HERMIONE'S HAND.  Clinched tight
in her stiff knuckles, barely visible, is... a PIECE OF
PAPER.

McGonagall reads from a PARCHMENT to the somber
Gryffindors.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
All students will return to their
house common rooms by six o'clock
in the evening.  You will be
escorted to each lesson by a
teacher.  No exceptions.

(rolling up
 the parchment)

I should tell you all this.
Unless the culprit behind these
attacks is caught, it is likely
that the school will be closed.

McGonagall turns, exits.  Instantly, as one, the
students begin to talk amongst themselves.  Neville
speaks up.

NEVILLE

Haven't any of the teachers
noticed that the Slytherins are
all safe?  Isn't it obvious all
this stuff's coming from
Slytherin?  The Heir of Slytherin,
the monster of Slytherin -- why
don't they just chuck all the
Slytherins out?

HARRY

We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him.  But if
he did set the monster loose last
time -- even by accident -- he'll
know how to get inside the Chamber
of Secrets.  And that's a start.

Harry and Ron drop the cloak.  Hagrid lowers the
crossbow.

114

INT. HAGRID'S HUT - NIGHT

114

FANG, Hagrid's enormous BOARHOUND, THUMPS HIS TAIL at the
sight of Harry and Ron.  Harry points to the crossbow.

What's that for?

HARRY

HAGRID

Nothin', nothin'.  I've been
expectin'... Doesn't matter.  Sit
down... I'll make tea...

Hagrid nervously takes the kettle, spills the water..

HARRY

Are you okay?  Hagrid?  Did you
hear about Hermione?

Oh, yea.  I heard, all righ'.

HAGRID

HARRY

Look... we have to ask you
something.  Do you know whoâs
opened the Chamber of Secrets?

Hagrid takes a fruit cake, stops, about to answer,
when... there is a LOUD KNOCK.  The fruitcake SMASHES to
the floor.  Panicked, Harry and Ron throw the cloak over
themselves.  Sweating, Hagrid grabs his crossbow, points
it at the door.

C-come in.

HAGRID

The door opens.  A grim Dumbledore enters, followed by a
portly man in a pin-stripe suit and bowler:  CORNELIUS
FUDGE.

Good evening, Hagrid.

FUDGE

Bad business, Hagrid.  Very bad
business.  Had to come.  Four
attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things've gone far enough.
Ministry's got to act.

HAGRID

I never... You know I never,
Professor Dumbledore, sir...

DUMBLEDORE

I want it understood, Cornelius,
that Hagrid has my full
confidence.

FUDGE

Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's
against him.  I've got to take
him.

HAGRID

Take me?  Where?  Not Azkaban
prison.

FUDGE

For a short stretch only.  Not a
punishment, Hagrid.  More a
precaution.  If someone else is
caught, you'll be released with a
full apology.

Just then, there is a SHARP RAP on the door.  As
Dumbledore opens it, Harry slumps.  It's Lucius
Malfoy.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Already here, Fudge?  Good,

LUCIUS MALFOY

My dear man, please believe me, I
have no pleasure at all in being
inside your -- do you call this a
house?  I simply called at the
school and was told the Headmaster
was here.

DUMBLEDORE

And what exactly did you want with
me, Lucius?

LUCIUS MALFOY

Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but
the governors feel it's time for
you to step aside.  This is an
Order of Suspension.  You'll find
all twelve signatures on it.  I'm
afraid we feel you're losing your
touch.  What with all these
attacks, there'll be no Muggle-
borns left at Hogwarts.  And we
all know what an awful loss that
would be.

Malfoy hands Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT.

FUDGE

Now, see here, Lucius.  Dumbledore
suspended.  No, no... last thing
we want right now... If Dumbledore
can't stop these attacks... I mean
to say, who can?

LUCIUS MALFOY

That remains to be seen, but as
all twelve governors have voted --

HAGRID

An' how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed!

LUCIUS MALFOY

I would advise you not to shout at
the Azkaban guards like that.

HAGRID

Yeh can take Dumbledore!  Take him
away an' the Muggle-borns won'
stand a chance!  There'll be
killin's next!

DUMBLEDORE

Calm yourself, Hagrid!
(steely-eyed)

If the governors want my removal,
Lucius, I shall of course step
aside.  However... you will find
that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me.  You will also find
that help will always be given at
Hogwarts to those who... ask for
it.

Dumbledore's eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Admirable sentiments.  We shall
all miss your highly individual
way of running things, Albus, and
only hope your successor will
manage to prevent any more, um,
killin's.

Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out.
Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waits for Hagrid.
Instead, Hagrid stands his ground, takes a deep breath
and says carefully...

HAGRID

If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff, all they'd have ter do is
follow the spiders.  That'd lead
'em right!  Tha's all I'm sayin'.

Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement, then follows him
out.  As the door SLAMS SHUT, FANG starts to HOWL,
scratching at the closed door.  Harry and Ron emerge from
the cloak.

RON

Hagrid's right.  With Dumbledore
gone, there'll be an attack a day.

Look...

HARRY

At the windowsill, a TRAIL OF SPIDERS escapes through a
crack in the glass.  Harry grabs Hagrid's LANTERN.

Harry illuminates the TRAIL OF SPIDERS.  They run from

What are you doing?

RON

HARRY

You heard Hagrid.  Follow the
spiders.

RON

They're heading into the Dark

Harry sighs, heads off.  Terrified, Ron grabs Fang,
follows.

NOISE sounds, then... SILENCE.  Harry spies something,
points O.S.

HARRY

There's something moving over
there... something big.

Just then a BLAZE of LIGHT splinters the trees, blinding
them.  They start to flee... when Ron stops.

Harry!... Harry, it's our car!

RON

Scratched and mud-smeared, with bits of earth and grass
sprouting from its headlamps and hubcaps -- the Ford
Anglia looks half-animal.  Ron circles it in wonder.

121A

EXT. SPIDERS' HOLLOW - NIGHT

121A

Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows.
Enormous trees tower over them, strewn with strands of
white webbing.  Ron steps on a strand, kicks it off
queasily.  Harry peers up ahead:  at the far end of the
hollow, the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING.

As Harry and Ron approach the opening, a CLICKING SOUND
emanates from within, ECHOING in the branches of the tall
trees.  GROWING LOUDER.  Ron falters, glancing about
nervously.

RON

I don't have a good feeling about
this, Harry --

Don't panic.

HARRY

As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR
suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT.  TWIGS SNAP.  A HUGE
SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry.  He peers up.
SEES:

An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG), the size of a small elephant.
As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away.  Then:
its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS.  As if...
listening.

ARAGOG

You do not come from the forest.
Your hearts beat like... men.

HARRY

(breathing finally)

Yes.  We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you... you're...

Hearing this, Aragog's head turns slightly.

ARAGOG

Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before.

HARRY

He's in trouble.  Up at school,
there've been attacks.  They think
it's Hagrid.  They think he's
opened the Chamber of Secrets.
Like before.

As Harry talks, Ron's eyes dart warily about, then...

RON'S POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDER'S LEGS -- curl
slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left.

Terrified, Ron NUDGES Harry, but Harry ignores him.

ARAGOG

That's a lie!  Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets!

HARRY

But if Hagrid never... that
means... you're not the monster.

ARAGOG

The monster was born in the
castle.  I came from a distant
land, in the pocket of a traveler.

Ron turns.  TWO CRAWLING SILHOUETTES inch forward.
Pause.  Waiting.  Watching.

Harry...

Shhh!

RON

HARRY

(to Aragog)

But if you're not the monster,
what did kill that girl fifty
years ago?

ARAGOG

We do not speak of it!  It is an
ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others.

But have you seen it?

A SCRABBLING SOUND ECHOES above Ron.  He GLANCES UP:  a
SPIDER crouches on a branch above.

ARAGOG

I never saw any part of the castle
but the cupboard in which Hagrid
kept me.  The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.  When I was
accused, Hagrid brought me here.

More SCRABBLING.  Ron looks up.  We PAN UP with him.
SEE:  SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING
DOWNWARD like paratroopers.  Ron GRABS Harry.

HARRY

(annoyed)

What!

Ron points.  Harry looks.  Pales.  Turns slowly back to
Aragog.

HARRY

Well... thank you.  We'll just
go...

ARAGOG

Go?  I think not.  My sons and
daughters do not harm Hagrid, on
my command.  But I cannot deny
them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

Aragog turns, disappears into the shadows of the cavern.

RON
Can we panic now?

CLICK!  CLICK!  CLICK!  Harry and Ron SPIN.  A GANG of
FIVE-FOOT SPIDERS bar the path ahead.  Begin to move
forward.  Harry and Ron SPIN again:  SPIDERS.
Everywhere.  CLOSING IN.

Desperately, Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand.  The
spiders falter, then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of
the LIGHT chases itself away.  Around and around.  Then:

The LANTERN goes out.

Harry pitches it aside.  As one, he and Ron draw their
wands.

closer, CLICKING FEVERISHLY, when...

... a LONG, LOUD HORN BLEATS.  Seconds later, a BLAZE of
LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes
THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope, KNOCKING
SPIDERS OUT OF ITS PATH.  As it SCREECHES to a halt, the
DOORS FLING OPEN.

Let's go!

HARRY

Harry, Ron and Fang LEAP INSIDE.  Ron SHIFTS FRANTICALLY.
A SPIDER appears at Harry's open window.

THE WINDOWS!  ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

HARRY

RON
(trying)

I CAN'T!  IT'S STUCK!

Just then, a hairy leg reaches through Ron's window.
Instantly, Ron HITS the gas, throws the car into REVERSE.

Spiders scatter, but the TWO clinging to the side windows
hold tight.  As the CAR ZOOMS BACKWARDS out of the
hollow, Harry rolls his window tight, SNAPPING OFF his
SPIDER'S LEGS.

shadows whipping past.

RON

car flies over a ridge, they see them:  a SEA OF SPIDERS
heading straight for them like a herd of raging
wildebeest.  Ron puts his foot to the floor, SPINS the
wheel and sends the car sliding away.  The spiders
STAMPEDE after.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT

The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest, skimming past
trees as the spiders CHARGE after.  Harry peers ahead,
SEES an area of FALLEN TREES.  There is an OPENING, one
narrow escape route.

HARRY

That way!  It's the only way out!

(looking back)

Hurry!  They're catching up!

Ron JAMS the accelerator... just as a GIANT TARANTULA
drops in front of the escape route.  Harry and Ron are as
good as dead.

Can you get us in the air?

HARRY

RON

(jostling the
 gear stick)
Flying gear's jammed!

The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER.  The TARANTULA waits
ahead.  Harry claps his hand over Ron's on the gear
shift, pushing.  The tarantula's pincers open, ready to
kill, when... the GEAR SHIFT GIVES, the Anglia's wheels
LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA, leaving the furious
spiders below.  The car barely avoids the rearing
tarantula, then sails over the trees.

Ron shifts uncomfortably.

RON

We know that, Madam Pomfrey.  It's

A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfrey's eyes.

about it.

As she exits, the boys step to her bed.  Absently, Ron
picks up the circular mirror that lies on the nightstand.

'Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land, none is more deadly
than the Basilisk.  Capable of
living for hundreds of years,
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.  Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it.'

(looking up)

Ron!  This is it!  The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk.  That's why I can hear
it speak.  It's a snake.

RON

But it kills by looking people in
the eye.  Why is it no one's dead?

Harry frowns, contemplating this, then catches he and
Ron's REFLECTION in the window opposite.  He mutters
SOFTLY:

HARRY

Because no one did look it in the
eye.  Not directly at least...

Colin saw it through his camera.

Lockhart walks ahead of Harry and Ron, their wands
pointed at him.  Moaning Myrtle floats above the cistern.

MOANING MYRTLE

Who's there?  Oh...

(smiles, flirty)

Hello, Harry.  What do you want?

To ask you how you died.

HARRY

MOANING MYRTLE

(flattered)

Oooooh, it was dreadful.  It
happened right here.  In this very
cubicle.  I'd hidden because Olive
Hornby was teasing me about my
glasses.  I was crying, and then I
heard somebody come in.

HARRY
Who was it, Myrtle?

MOANING MYRTLE

I don't know!  I was distraught!
But they said something funny.  A
kind of made-up language.  And I
realized it was a boy speaking.
So I unlocked the door, to tell
him to go away, and... I died.

Just like that?  How?

HARRY

MOANING MYRTLE

No idea.  I just remember seeing a
pair of great big yellow eyes.
Over there...

Myrtle points to the bank of sinks.  Harry and Ron hurry
over, examining the pipes below, the tile above, then...
Harry sees it:  etched on one of the COPPER TAPS is a
TINY SNAKE.

HARRY

This is it, Ron.  This is the
entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets.

RON

Say something, Harry.  Say
something in Parseltongue.

Harry stares off self-consciously at the tiny snake.

Open up.

HARRY

Ron shakes his head.  Harry's spoken in his regular
voice.

English.

RON

Harry concentrates harder this time, staring so intensely
that the snake almost looks alive.  When, finally, he
speaks, it is more like a HISS.  Parseltongue.  The
circular group of sinks OPEN and a LARGE, OPEN PIPE is
exposed.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

Excellent, Harry.  Good work.
Well then.  I'll just be going.
There's no need for me...

Oh, yes there is.  You first.

HARRY

Harry points his wand at Lockhart, then the opening.

Now, boys.  What good will it do?

GILDEROY LOCKHART

RON

A bloody lot of good if it's a
two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged
rocks.

Lockhart steps grimly to the dark, gaping hole.  Ron
gives him a shove and he topples headfirst and out of
sight.  They wait.  Finally...

GILDEROY LOCKHART (O.S.)

It's really quite filthy down
here.

All right.  Let's go.

HARRY

MOANING MYRTLE
Oh, Harry... if you die down
there, you're welcome to share my
toilet.

Thanks, Myrtle.

HARRY

Harry turns.  Jumps.  Seconds later, Ron follows.

131

INT. PIPE - NIGHT

Harry and Ron slide wicked fast, in a hair-raising
vertical plummet, catching glimpses of other, smaller
pipes branching off in all directions, twisting and
turning until the pipe levels off, dumps them onto the
damp floor of a stone tunnel.

132

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Lockhart stares miserably at the muck dripping from his
robes.  Harry takes a TORCH from the wall, poises his
wand.

131

132

Lumos!

HARRY

The torch blooms with a BRIGHT ORANGE FLAME.

HARRY

Remember.  Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straight away.

Harry leads the way down the tunnel.  CRUNCH!  They look
down:  a rat's skull.  All around them, the ground is
littered with TINY SKELETONS.  Ron squints, sees
something HUGE and CURVED lying ahead.  When he speaks,
his voice is hollow with dread.

What's that?  Up ahead?

RON

That looks like a... snake.

GILDEROY LOCKHART

132

Terrified, Lockhart quickly HIDES HIS EYES.

HARRY
Maybe it's asleep.

Ron draws his wand as they approach, squinting.  Harry
shines his light, revealing... a gigantic COIL of EMPTY
SKIN.

RON

Bloody hell.  Whatever shed this
must be twenty feet long.  Or
more.

THUD!  They turn.  Lockhart has passed out.

Heart of a lion, this one.

RON

Ron kneels by him, when... Lockhart's eyes open and,
quick as a fox... he snatches Ron's wand and scrambles to
his feet.

GILDEROY LOCKHART
The adventure ends here, boys!
But don't fret.  The world will
know our story.  How I was too
late to save the girl.  How you
two tragically lost your minds at
the sight of her mangled body.
I'll even bind a limited edition
in this snake skin.  Say goodbye
to your memories.

(raising Ron's wand)

Obliviate!

Ron's WAND EXPLODES like a small BOMB, BLASTING Lockhart
OFF HIS FEET and SPITTING great JETS of FIRE into the
rock above.  As RUBBLE RAINS, Ron LEAPS one way and Harry
the other.  Harry sits up, squints through the settling
dust.  A SOLID WALL of BROKEN ROCK seals the tunnel
between him and Ron.  INTERCUT Harry and Ron.

HARRY
Ron?  Are you okay?

He got blasted by my wand.

Lockhart sits up, dazed.  Ron picks up a rock and CONKS
him on the head.  Lockhart PASSES OUT.  Ron calls to
Harry.

What now?

RON

HARRY

Wait here.  I'll go on.  I'll go
on and... find Ginny.  If I'm not
back in an hour...

He leaves it there.

RON

I'll try and shift some of this
rock.  So you can get back
through.  And, Harry --

See you in a bit.

HARRY

Harry glances at the snake skin at his feet, moves off.
He steps carefully through the shadows until he reaches a
TOWERING STONE WALL, carved with TWIN SERPENTS.

HARRY

(Parseltongue)

Open.

The serpents part and the GIANT WALL SLIDES OPEN.  Harry
removes his wand and ENTERS.

133

INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT

133

A vast chamber stretches ahead.  Along the path are rows
of STONE SERPENTS.  The serpents rest in pools of black
water.  Ahead is an enormous STATUE of SALAZAR SLYTHERIN.
Several feet in front of the statue, Ginny Weasley lies
motionless.  As Harry dashes and takes her into his arms,
her head lolls to one side, cheeks white as marble.  A
pale hand clutches TOM RIDDLE'S DIARY to her chest.
Harry DROPS the torch, RACES to Ginny, places his wand on
the floor and kneels beside her.  (BOLD ITALICS INDICATE
POSSIBLE FLASHBACKS.)

HARRY

Ginny!  Please don't be dead.
Ginny!  Wake up!  Wake up!

TOM RIDDLE

Harry spins.  Tom Riddle stands nearby.  He is strangely
BLURRED around the edges, as though Harry was looking at
him through a misted window.

HARRY

Tom... Tom Riddle?  What d'you
mean, she won't wake?  She's
not...

She's still alive.  But only just.

TOM RIDDLE

Are you a ghost?

HARRY

TOM RIDDLE

A memory.  Preserved in a diary
for fifty years.

Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's hand, then places his
own hand on Ginny's arm.

HARRY

She's cold as ice.  You've got
to help me, Tom.  There's a
basilisk --

It won't come until it's called.

TOM RIDDLE

Harry looks up, sees Riddle twirling a wand in his
fingers.

Give me my wand, Tom.

HARRY

TOM RIDDLE
You won't be needing it.

HARRY

Listen, we've got to go!  We've
got to save her!

TOM RIDDLE

I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry.
You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker... I grow stronger.

But she's dying!

TOM RIDDLE

Yes.  I'm afraid so.  But then,
she's been in so much pain, poor
Ginny.  She's been writing to me
for months, telling me all her
pitiful worries and woes.  Ginny
poured her soul out to me.  I grew
stronger on a diet of her deepest
fears, her darkest secrets.  I
grew powerful enough to start
feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
start pouring a bit of my soul
back into her...

Riddle, growing less vaporous by the second, grins
cruelly.

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

HARRY

No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't.

TOM RIDDLE

It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
cat.  Ginny who wrote threatening
messages on the walls.

But... Why?...

HARRY

TOM RIDDLE

Because I told her to.  You'll
find that I can be very
persuasive.  Not that she knew
what she was doing.  She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls'
bathroom.  But then, who should
find it... but you.  The very
person I was most anxious to meet.

HARRY

(getting angry)

TOM RIDDLE

Ginny told me all about you.  I
knew I had to talk to you, meet
you if I could.  So I decided to
show you my capture of that
brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
your trust.

HARRY

Hagrid's my friend.  And you
framed him, didn't you?

TOM RIDDLE

It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent.

HARRY

I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you.

TOM RIDDLE

I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school.  So I decided to
leave behind a diary, preserving
my sixteen-year-old self in its
pages, so that one day... I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherin's noble work.

HARRY

Well, you haven't finished it this
time.  In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again.

TOM RIDDLE

Haven't I told you, that killing
Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore?  For many months now, my
new target has been... you.

(grinning)

Imagine my disappointment when I
learned Ginny had stolen the diary
back from you.

She was afraid.  Afraid you'd

Afraid I'd tell you just who it
was that had been strangling all
those roosters.

Horrified, Harry glances at Ginny, growing more PALE,
then back to Riddle, who is growing more SOLID.

TOM RIDDLE

Come now, Harry.  Don't look so
disappointed.  Had Ginny succeeded
in destroying the diary, she would
have destroyed me.  And we
couldn't be having this little
talk.  And I have so many
questions for you.

Like what?

HARRY

TOM RIDDLE

Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time?  How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,
while Lord Voldemort's powers were
destroyed?

HARRY

Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

TOM RIDDLE

Voldemort is my past, present and
future.

Riddle pulls Harry's wand from his pocket and begins to
trace it through the air, writing three words:  "TOM
MARVOLO RIDDLE." Then, with a wave, he re-arranges them:
"I AM LORD VOLDEMORT."

HARRY

You.  You're the heir of
Slytherin.  You're Voldemort?

TOM RIDDLE

Surely you didn't think I would
keep my filthy Muggle father's
name?

TOM RIDDLE (CONT'D)
No, I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere
would one day fear to speak, when
I became the greatest sorcerer in
the world.

HARRY

Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
sorcerer in the world!

TOM RIDDLE

Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of
me.

HARRY

He'll never be gone!  Not as long
as those who remain are loyal to
him!

Suddenly, MUSIC... EERIE and UNEARTHLY... ECHOES deep
within the chamber and a small, swift SHADOW ribbons over
the rock.  Flying from above is FAWKES, the Phoenix.  The
bird SWOOPS into the chamber, clutching a RAGGED BUNDLE
in its golden talons.

Fawkes.

HARRY

Fawkes flies toward Harry, drops the ragged bundle, which
is the SORTING HAT, at his feet.  Riddle picks it up.

TOM RIDDLE

(giggling)

This is what Dumbledore sends his
defender!  A songbird and an old
hat!

Riddle tosses aside the hat.  He turns to the statue of
Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)

Speak to me, Slytherin.

Suddenly, the stone face's MOUTH OPENS.  There is a
RUMBLING SOUND, followed by the sound of SLITHERING.
Harry turns away.  The Basilisk, A GIANT SERPENT, spills
out, uncoiling heavily to the floor.  Harry turns to the
wall.  The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall.
PAN TO Tom Riddle, looking at Harry.

Riddle turns, to serpent, speaking in Parseltongue.

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)

Kill him!

The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward.  Harry turns, RUNS away.

TOM RIDDLE

Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter.  The Basilisk only obeys me.

HARRY
(to himself)

Don't look.  Don't look into its
eyes.

Harry RACES along the stone path, but the giant serpent
is FASTER.  Harry TRIPS.  FALLS.  The Basilisk RISES.
Harry looks to the wall, sees the serpent about to strike.

Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES, soaring toward the Basilisk
and circling its blunt head, confusing it.  The SNAKE
SNAPS furiously, when... Fawkes drops like a knife,
driving its talons deep into the serpent's glittering
eyes.

As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall,
the BASILISK ROARS, HISSING in pain.  Fawkes wings away,
its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns, LOOKS:
the Basilisk's eyes are a blind, bloody mess.

TOM RIDDLE

Fool!  Think you're safe!  It can
still hear you!

As Harry flees, the serpent thunders after, STRIKING
BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE.
Harry dodges and ducks, then, seeing the snake about to
strike again... LEAPS CLEAR, stumbling toward a SIDE
TUNNEL.

face.  Harry trembles as the snake's head cocks to the
side, then... finally... WITHDRAWS.

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, Potter.  The process is
nearly complete.  In a few
minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead.  And I will cease to be a
memory.  Lord Voldemort will
return.  Very much... alive.

Harry moves toward Ginny, then suddenly... the BASILISK
SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL, HISSING directly in front of
Harry.  Trapped, Harry glances around, then --
impulsively -- LEAPS upward, begins to scale the statue
of Salazar Slytherin.  The serpent strikes madly, but
Harry continues on, CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top.  He turns.  Sees the Sorting Hat.  Sees what
glitters within:  the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD.

Harry WHEELS, sword in hand, and fends off the slashing
serpent like St. George and the dragon.  In a mad rush of
courage, he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent, SLIDES DOWN
its back and rolls up, SWORD RAISED.  Too tired to flee,
Harry simply waits.  The serpent rises and, FANGS
BARED... STRIKES.

Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him, Harry
drives the sword upward, deep into the roof of the
SERPENT'S mouth.  It HISSES in PAIN, thrashing MADLY as
it drives a FANG into Harry's arm.  Harry clutches his
arm in agony, stumbles back and falls to the floor,
watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly... then goes
STILL.

Harry peers down, sees the FANG that pierces his arm, the
blood soaking slowly into his robe.  As he yanks the fang
free, Riddle steps forward, almost fully whole now.  His
eyes shine at the sight of Harry's wound.

TOM RIDDLE

Remarkable, isn't it?  How quickly
the venom of the Basilisk
penetrates the body?  If you have
any final words, Potter, you'd
best speak them now.  I'd guess
you have little more than a minute
to live.

Harry blinks heavily, watching as the skin of his forearm
turns a troubling gray.

As Riddle talks, Harry glances at Ginny, nearly white

TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER.  Harry studies the finger
and what lies beneath it:  Tom Riddle's diary.  Harry

then... slips the diary free.

What are you doing?  No.  Stop...

TOM RIDDLE

Riddle's face creases in fear.  He LUNGES FORWARD.  But
Harry is too quick.  Raising his hand high... he PLUNGES
THE FANG into the book.  Instantly, BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages.

No!

TOM RIDDLE

Riddle SHRIEKS, writhing in pain.  His body begins to
wither instantly, growing BLURRY once more.  As the ink
runs off Harry's fingers to the floor, Riddle VANISHES
altogether.  Harry sinks back, then... hears a FAINT
MOAN.  Ginny STIRS, color blooming in her cheeks.  As she
sees Harry, she SOBS.

GINNY

Harry.  It was me!  But I swear, I
didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
He wrote to me... took me over...

There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down, lays
his head onto Harry's arm.

DUMBLEDORE

Ingenious.  Simply... ingenious.

Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever seen.  I taught
him myself fifty years ago.  After
he left, I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile, even
the rumors stopped.  When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort, most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy he'd once been.

Weasley.  No, I think you've

chocolate.  I always find that

can think for itself if you can't
see where it keeps its brain!

Determination.  A certain
disregard for the rules.  Yet the

Suddenly, Lucius Malfoy enters, dragging... Dobby by the
ear.

HARRY

Dobby!  This is your Master?  The
family you serve is the Malfoys!

Dobby nods, chagrined.  Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Out of my way, Potter.
(to Dumbledore)

So!  You've returned!

DUMBLEDORE

Yes.  When the governors heard
that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
been taken into the Chamber, they
saw fit to summon me back.

(a wry smile)

Curiously, several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if they
didn't agree to suspend me in the
first place, Lucius.

LUCIUS MALFOY
From the beginning, my only
concern has been the welfare of
this school and its students.
I assume the culprit has been
identified.

DUMBLEDORE

Oh yes.  It was Voldemort.  Only
this time, he chose to act through
someone else.  By means of...
this.

As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy,
Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to
Lucius.

DUMBLEDORE

Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

(a chill to his voice)
One only hopes that no more of
Lord Voldemort's old school things
find their way into innocent
hands.  The consequences for the
one responsible could be...
severe.

Lucius Malfoy stares icily at Dumbledore, then turns
away.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Come, Dobby.  We're leaving.

As Dobby scuttles toward the door, Lucius Malfoy KICKS
HIM through it, then exits himself.  Harry stares at the
empty doorway as DOBBY'S PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the
corridor.

HARRY

Sir?  I wonder if I could have
that.

Dumbledore looks up, follows Harry's eyes to the diary.

135A

EXT. DUMBLEDORE'S OFFICE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

135A

As the elevator opens, Harry dashes out.

HARRY

Mr. Malfoy!  I have something of
yours.

Harry comes up running, thrusts the diary into Malfoy's
hand.

LUCIUS MALFOY

Mine?  I don't know what you're
talking about.

HARRY

I think you do, sir.  I think you
slipped it into Ginny Weasley's
cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.

Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobby's face, then leans
close to Harry and, with a nasty grin, WHISPERS:

Prove it!

LUCIUS MALFOY

He turns away.  As Dobby looks sadly back, clutching the
diary in his hand, Harry mouths the words:  Open it.
Dobby looks down curiously.  Inside... is a SOCK.  He
GASPS.

Dobby, come!  Dobby!

DOBBY

(in wonderment)

Master has given Dobby a sock.
Master has presented Dobby with
clothes.  Dobby is... free!

What?  I didn't --

LUCIUS MALFOY

He wheels, sees Harry standing with one leg crossed:  His
right ankle is bare.  Instantly, Malfoy charges forth.

LUCIUS MALFOY
You've lost me my servant!

You shall not harm Harry Potter!

DOBBY

Dobby steps between and -- BANG!  Malfoy flies backwards,
lands in a crumpled heap.  Rising, he stares murderously
at Harry.

LUCIUS MALFOY
Mark my words, Harry Potter.
You'll meet the same sticky end as
your parents one of these days.
They were meddlesome fools too.

With that, he turns, storms off.

DOBBY

Harry Potter freed Dobby!  How can
Dobby ever repay him?

Just promise me something.

HARRY

Anything, sir.

DOBBY

Never try to save my life again.

HARRY

Dobby grins then and -- CRACK! -- is gone.

INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Fear and suspicion banished, the House tables abuzz with
excitement and anticipation... all except the Slytherins,
who do not share the general feeling.

Seated at the tables, are the formerly petrified, revived
students.  Justin Finch-Fletchley joins his fellow
Hufflepuffs.  Colin Creevey SNAPS photos of the
proceedings.

At the rear of the hall, standing near the entrance,
Filch is reunited with Mrs. Norris.  Then... Hermione
enters, searching the room for Harry and Ron.  Finally,
she sees them.  Smiles.  Runs forward and embraces Harry.

You solved it!  You solved it!

HERMIONE

With loads of help from you.

HARRY

She turns to embrace Ron.  They pause, an awkward moment
between them and... shake hands instead.

Welcome back, Hermione.

RON

McGonagall taps her goblet.  Dumbledore stands.

DUMBLEDORE

Before we begin our feast, let's
give a round of applause to
Professor Sprout and Madame
Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
been successfully administered to
all those who had been petrified.

Everyone applauds.

DUMBLEDORE

Also, in the wake of recent
events, as a school treat, all
exams have been cancelled.

Everyone cheers, save for Hermione.

Oh, no!

HERMIONE

At the rear of the Hall, the great doors OPEN.  It's
Hagrid.  He enters.  Stops.  Looks around.  The room
falls SILENT.  All eyes upon him.  He glances around.
Nervous.  Embarrassed.

HAGRID

Sorry I'm late.  The owl deliverin'
my release papers got all lost 'n
confused.  Some ruddy bird named
Errol.

Ron exchanges a nervous glance with Dumbledore.  Hagrid
looks at all of the faces staring at him.  He turns to
Harry.

HAGRID

I jus' want to say... that if it
wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an'
Ron... and Hermione... Well, I
jus' want to say... Thanks.

HARRY

There's no Hogwarts without you,
Hagrid.

Just then... Dumbledore gets to his feet and... slowly...
brings his hands together.  The others join him.  Soon,
everyone is on their feet and the Hall ROARING.  As the
students surround Hagrid, he blinks, wipes at his eyes,
and...

CAMERA PULLS BACK, THROUGH the window, leaving the
celebration.  WE CONTINUE TO CRANE BACK... BACK... TO a
WIDE SHOT OF HOGWARTS... glittering gloriously in the
night.

FADE TO BLACK.
