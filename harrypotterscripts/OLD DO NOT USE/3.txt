EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

The street slumbers, adrift in shadow.  Then... a curious
BEAM OF LIGHT BOBS beyond the second-story window of
Number Four.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A tent of blankets.  Within... the SHADOW of a BOY.  A
WHISPER:

Lumos Maxima...

HARRY

The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly illuminating
a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James & Lily Potter) -- then
goes dark.

Lumos Maxima...

HARRY

The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a
TOILET FLUSHES.  Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the
blankets DIM, and the tent flattens.  Just as...

... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON.
He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then...
withdraws.

The tent rises.

Lumos Maxima...

HARRY

As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY
with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
crookedly atop his nose:  HARRY POTTER.  Open before him
is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations.  Once again, he
speaks:

Lumos... MAXIMA!

HARRY

A BLINDING BLAST OF LIGHT FLASHES from the second story
window of Number Four.  DOGS BARK.  And a TITLE CARD
appears:

HARRY POTTER

Prisoner of Azkaban

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT

The light in the hallway SNAPS on, Harry's tent droops
once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open.
Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light.  The
room is utterly SILENT.  Slowly, he closes the door.

INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - STAIRWAY/FRONT HALL - DAY

The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS:

Harry!  Harry!

AUNT PETUNIA (O.S.)

Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall,
where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
door.

Well, go on.  Open it.

AUNT PETUNIA

Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER).  Uncle Vernon lurches
forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand, and drops it on Harry.

AUNT PETUNIA

Marge!  Welcome!  How was the
train?

Wretched.  Ripper got sick.

AUNT MARGE

Ah.  How... unfortunate.

AUNT PETUNIA

AUNT MARGE

I would've left him with the
others, but he pines so when I'm
away.  Don't you, darling?

Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway.  Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.

HARRY

Uncle Vernon.  I need you to sign
this form.

What is it?

UNCLE VERNON

Nothing.  Something for school...

HARRY

Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's hand
suspiciously.

Later perhaps.  If you behave.

UNCLE VERNON

HARRY
I will if she does.

AUNT MARGE

(turning, eyeing Harry)

So.  Still here, are you?

Yes.

HARRY

AUNT MARGE

Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful
tone.  Damn good of my brother to
keep you, if you ask me.

(to Vernon, Petunia)
It'd have been straight to an
orphanage if he'd been dumped on
my doorstep.

Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.

AUNT MARGE

Is that my Dudders!  Hm?  Is that
my neffy poo?  Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge.

Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES.  Dudley blinks,
waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle.

As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Can I tempt you, Marge?

UNCLE VERNON

AUNT MARGE

Just a small one.  A bit more... a
bit more... That's the boy.

(taking a
 sloppy sip)

Aah.  Excellent nosh, Petunia.
It's normally just a fry-up for
me, what with twelve dogs.

She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
Harry looking.

AUNT MARGE

What are you smirking at!  Where
is it that you send him, Vernon?

UNCLE VERNON

St. Brutus's.  It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.

Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
glares darkly at him.

AUNT MARGE

I see.  And do they use the cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?

HARRY

(sarcastically)

Oh, yes.  I've been beaten loads
of times.

AUNT MARGE

Excellent.  I won't have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it.

(another sip)

Still.  Mustn't blame yourself for
how this one's turned out, Vernon.
It all comes down to blood.  Bad
blood will out.  What is it the
boy's father did, Petunia?

AUNT PETUNIA

(agitated)

Nothing.  That is... he didn't
work.  He was -- unemployed.

(CONTINUED)

7

CONTINUED:  (2)

AUNT MARGE
Of course.  And a drunk,
I expect --

That's a lie.

HARRY

Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.

What did you say?

AUNT MARGE

My dad wasn't a drunk.

HARRY

POP!  The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.

Oh my goodness!  Marge!

AUNT PETUNIA

AUNT MARGE

Not to worry, Petunia.  I have a
very firm grip.

Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.

You go to bed.  Now.

UNCLE VERNON

AUNT MARGE

Quiet, Vernon.  It doesn't matter
about the father.  In the end it
comes down to the mother.  You see
it all the time with dogs.  If
there's something wrong with the
bitch, there'll be something wrong
with the pup...

HARRY
Shut up!  Shut up!

Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air.  SEAMS GROAN.  THREAD
SNAPS.  Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN.  Her cheeks BILLOW.  Her
whole body BILLOWS.  And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON.

MARGE!

UNCLE VERNON

As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her.  RIPPER GROWLS,
fixes his teeth to his trousers.  Harry frightened by
what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY across
the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.

EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK

The others race outside.  As Aunt Marge begins to float
away, Uncle Vernon grips her hands.

Don't worry!  I've got you...

UNCLE VERNON

Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
RISE.  Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...

Vernon.  Don't you dare --

AUNT MARGE

But he does.  He lets go.  Falls to his knees.  And
watches Aunt Marge float away.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER)

Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
hiding place.  Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
parents.

INT. HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER)

BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  Harry tows the TRUNK down the
stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.

UNCLE VERNON

YOU BRING HER BACK!  YOU BRING HER
BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!

HARRY

No!  She deserved what she got!
And you... you keep away from me.

Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
knowing cruelty.

UNCLE VERNON

You're not allowed to do magic out
of school.  They won't have you
now.  You've got nowhere to go.

Harry realizes it's true.  Briefly falters.  Then:

Anywhere's better than here.

HARRY

EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER)

As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the
street WITH him.  High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
Aunt Marge.

10

EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER)

8.

10

Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops.  Glances
about.  An empty PLAYGROUND.  SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains.  A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
wind, turning slowly.

Harry drops the trunk.  Sits.  Deep in the night, an
ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT.  Harry, still as a statue.
Listening.  In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE.  The WIND
gathers.

Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
Then, he... stiffens.  Turns back.  Sensing something in
the shadows across the street, he rises.  Slowly draws
his wand.

Then he sees... it.  Something BIG.  Darker than the
shadows which conceal it.  Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
EYES.

Harry steps back.  Afraid to look.  Afraid not to.  Wand
outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
trunk.  The tip of his wand BLAZES.

BANG!  TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.

Aaaah!

HARRY

GIANT WHEELS bear down.  Harry rolls clear -- just as a
PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
halt.  GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen:  The
Knight Bus.

DOORS HISS.  Snap back.  REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18-
year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM.  Pasty
face.  Raccoon eyes.  Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
sun in years.

STAN SHUNPIKE
(wearily, drearily)
Welcome to the Knight Bus.
Emergency transport for the
stranded witch or wizard.  My name
is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this evening.

(peering at Harry)
Wha' choo doin' down there?

Fell over.

HARRY

Wha' choo fall over for?

STAN SHUNPIKE

(CONTINUED)

10

CONTINUED:

I didn't do it on purpose.

HARRY

Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.

STAN SHUNPIKE

Well, come on then.  Let's not
wait for the grass to grow.

9.

10

As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows
across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
aboard.

11

INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

11

No seats.  Only BEDS.  The BRASS frames need a shine, the
lines a wash.  In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
turns over in his sleep.

DISHEVELED WIZARD
Not now... I'm pickling slugs...

Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
sweat.  A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
mouth.

Take 'er away, Ern.

STAN SHUNPIKE

Yeah, take it away!

SHRUNKEN HEAD

BANG!  Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
six inches to the rear.  Harry drops onto the bed
nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
above his head.  Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
WHIPS past in a blur.

Wot you say your name was again?

STAN SHUNPIKE

I didn't.

HARRY

Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
more.  Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
past.

(CONTINUED)

11

CONTINUED:

Whereabouts you headin'?

STAN SHUNPIKE

10.

11

Harry hesitates.  He hadn't thought about this.  Decides.

HARRY

The Leaky Cauldron.  That's in
London --

STAN SHUNPIKE

Is it now?  Get that, Ern?  The
Leaky Cauldron.  That's in London.

Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.

SHRUNKEN HEAD

Leaky Cauldron!  Stay away from
the pea soup!

As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
out the windscreen, watches London careering by.

Isn't this a bit... dangerous?

HARRY

STAN SHUNPIKE

Naah.  Haven't had an accident
in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?

SHRUNKEN HEAD

Heads up!  Little old lady at
twelve o'clock!

Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
crossing the street.  Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
Harry flies forward, palms to the window.  The brakes
pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
Harry flies back onto his bed.  BANG!  The bus rockets
forward once more.

As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
Stan's Daily Prophet:  ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN!  Below, a
sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.

Who is that?  That man.

HARRY

STAN SHUNPIKE

Who is that?  That's Sirius Black,
that is.  Don' tell me you ne'er
been hearin' o' Sirius Black?

(CONTINUED)

11

CONTINUED:  (2)

11.

11

Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.

STAN SHUNPIKE

A murderer, he is.  Got 'imself
locked up in Azkaban for it.

How'd he escape?

HARRY

STAN SHUNPIKE

Tha's the question, isn't it?
He's the firs' that's done it.
Gives me the collywobbles thinking
he's out there, though, I'll tell
you that.  Big supporter of You-
Know-'Oo, Black was.  Reckon you
heard o' him.

Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift.  Meet
Harry's.

Yeah.  Him I've heard of.

HARRY

Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
toward the Knight Bus.  Before can scream, the entire
Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
two onrushing buses.  The Shrunken Head winces.

Hate that.

SHRUNKEN HEAD

This bus.  Don't the Muggles ever...

HARRY

STAN SHUNPIKE

Them!  Don' listen properly, do
they?  Don' look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don'.

Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past.  The
couple glances about in bewilderment.  The DOG YAPS
madly.

Turn!  Turn!

SHRUNKEN HEAD

Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
dizzying 360-degree turn.  HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is
sent flying once more.  Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
he pirouettes through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the
BRAKES.

12.

EXT. CHARING CROSS ROAD/LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT

12

The Knight Bus fishtails INTO VIEW and SQUEALS to a stop,
centimeters from a PARKED CAR.  WHOOSH!  The bus settles
and -- TINK! -- taps the bumper.  Instantly, the car's
ALARM wails.

12A

INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - SAME TIME - NIGHT

12A

The chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open.
The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears:
TOM, Innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron pub.

Mr. Potter... at last.

TOM

12B

EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

12B

As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are
revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above:  THE
LEAKY CAULDRON.  Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then
pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car
alarm.

13

INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS
LATER)

Harry trails Tom through the quiet room.  The BARTENDER
glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long.  A
solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF.  Tom leads Harry upstairs.

14

INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL
(HEDWIG) perched atop a chair.

13

14

Hedwig!

HARRY

TOM

Right smart bird you've got there,
Mr. Potter.  Arrived only minutes
before yourself.

A MAN CLEARS his throat.  Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
the ghostly shadows beyond.  Harry's reflection shivers
in the glass, but the man doesn't turn.  Tom takes a
position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his
palms.

(CONTINUED)

14

CONTINUED:

CORNELIUS FUDGE
I should tell you, Mr. Potter,
earlier this evening your uncle's
sister was located just south of
Sheffield, circling a chimney
stack.  The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched
and she's been properly punctured
and
her memory modified.  She has no
recollection of the incident
whatsoever.

Harry waits.  A man condemned.  Then Fudge turns.

So that's that, and no harm done.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

(smiling)

Pea soup?

Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut
sliver.

HARRY

No thank you.  Minister... I don't
understand.  I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to
use magic at home --

CORNELIUS FUDGE

(dishing up a bowl)

Oh, come now, Harry.  The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban for
blowing up their aunts!  On the
other hand... running away like
that... given the state of
things... very, very
irresponsible.

'The state of things' sir?

HARRY

CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.

HARRY

Sirius Black, you mean.  But...
what's that got to do with me?

CRACK!  Tom SHATTERS another WALNUT.  Fudge smiles
nervously.

(CONTINUED)

14

CONTINUED:  (2)

14.

14

CORNELIUS FUDGE

Hm?  Oh, nothing.  You're safe,
that's what matters.  Tomorrow
you'll be on your way to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them
brought here for you.

15

16

Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS.  One is bound by a ROPE.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

By the way, Harry.  Whilst you're
here it would be best if you
didn't... wander.

OMITTED

EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING

THROUGH the window:  the rooftops of London.  A TRAIN
PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing
with Hedwig.  He turns, eyes his schoolbooks.  He studies
the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then
gives the rope a tug.  Instantly...

... the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers
SNAPPING.  Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins
NIPPING viciously at his shoes.  Harry vaults atop the
bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
PILLOW.
Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry
POUNCES -- FLUMPH!  The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled
beneath the pillow.  Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to
rebind it.

INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - HALLWAY/ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING

A YOUNG WITCH in maid's robes pushes a cart down the
hall.  Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a
door.

Housekeeping.

YOUNG WITCH

As she opens the door, she's greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR
and a RUSH of WIND.

YOUNG WITCH

(unperturbed)
I'll come back later.

Something SMALL and FAST dashes by Harry's feet.
Looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking RAT (SCABBERS),
pursued by a decidedly UGLY ORANGE CAT (CROOKSHANKS).

RON (O.S.)

I'm warning you, Hermione!  Keep
that bloody beast of yours away

a tea cozy.

HERMIONE (O.S.)

He's a cat, Ronald!  What do you
expect?  It's in his nature.

As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY
protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER
does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.

RON

A cat!  Is that what they told
you?  Looks more like a pig with
hair if you ask me.

HERMIONE

That's rich coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

(cooing to the cat)

It's all right, Crookshanks.  You
just ignore the mean little boy...

Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.

As Ron smoothes the dog-eared clipping onto the table,
Harry studies it.  Hermione ignores it, stroking
Crookshanks.

Egypt!  What's it like?

HARRY

RON

Brilliant.  It's got loads of old
stuff.  Mummies.  Death masks.
Tombs --

HERMIONE

You know, the ancient Egyptians of
the Nile River delta worshipped
the cat goddess Bast.

Ron glares stonily at Hermione, then turns back to Harry.

I also got a new wand.

RON

Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD.  The Weasleys -- PERCY,
FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en
masse, laden with purchases from Diagon Alley.

GEORGE

Not flashing that clipping about
again, are you, Ron?

I haven't shown anyone!

RON

FRED

No, not a soul.  Unless you count
Tom.  The day maid.  The night
maid.  The cook.  The bloke that
came to fix the toilet.  That
wizard from Belgium...

Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles.  As
if relieved to see him.

It's good to see you, Harry.

MRS. WEASLEY

Of course, Mr. Weasley.

As Mr. Weasley pulls Harry away, the others continue to
hover over the clipping in the b.g.

FRED

George's nose looks positively
massive in that photograph.

That's your nose, Fred.

GINNY

FRED

Bloody hell.  'Tis, isn't it?
Take after your side of the
family, don't I, Mum?

Harry notices Mr. Weasley glance edgily at a FUGITIVE
POSTER tacked to the wall.  In it, SIRIUS BLACK glowers
under the words, "Have You Seen This Man?"

ARTHUR WEASLEY

Harry.  There are some within the
Ministry who would strongly
discourage me from divulging what
I'm about to tell you.  But I
think you need to know the facts.
Because you're in danger.  Grave
danger.

Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.

HARRY

Has this anything to do with him,
sir?

ARTHUR WEASLEY

What do you know of Sirius Black,
Harry?

HARRY

That he escaped from Azkaban.
That he killed someone...

Black lost everything.  But he
remains a loyal servant to this
day.  In his mind, only you stand
in the way of...

Once again, Mr. Weasley hesitates.

Voldemort...?

HARRY

Harry, I hate it when you say --

ARTHUR WEASLEY

I know, sorry.  Ron hates it too.

HARRY

ARTHUR WEASLEY

In Black's mind, only you stand in
the way of... You-Know-Who
returning to power.  That's why
he's broken.  That's why he's
broken out of Azkaban.  To find
you.  And...

Mr. Weasley hesitates yet again.

Kill me?

HARRY

Mr. Weasley nods.  Nervously.

ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry.  I want you to swear
that -- whatever you might hear --
you won't go looking for Black.

HARRY

Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

Mr. Weasley nods, then claps Harry on the shoulder.

Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.

I still think it was brilliant.

She points.  Stamped in peeling letters on a BATTERED
CASE is "Professor R.J. Lupin."

HARRY
Is he really asleep?

HERMIONE

Seems to be.  Why?  What is it,
Harry?

Close the door.

HARRY

Hermione and Ron exchange a curious glance, then Ron
rises, slides the door shut, OVER CAMERA, and we --

Ron and Hermione stare at Harry, faces stricken in the
lantern light that now glows in the compartment.

Crookshanks slumbers in his CAGE.

RON

Let me get this straight.  Sirius
Black escaped from Azkaban to come
after you?

Yes.

HARRY

HERMIONE

But they'll catch Black, won't
they?  I mean... eventually?

RON

Sure -- Of course, no one's ever
broken out of Azkaban before and
he's a raving, murderous
lunatic...

Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES.  Lanterns flicker.
The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW.  Hermione slides down
the seat, pinning Ron against the window.  They exchange
an awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the
other end of the seat and glances at her WATCH.  Frowns.

HERMIONE

Why're we stopping?  We can't be
there yet...

Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the
corridor.

HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out
curiously.  Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS --
and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...

A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Ron's mouth.  Harry notices.

Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?

HARRY

Ouch!  Ron, that was my foot!

HERMIONE

SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK.  Ron, a dark silhouette against the
window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.

RON

There's something moving out
there.  I think... people are
coming aboard.

Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently... rights itself.  The
METAL WINDOW TRIM at Ron's fingertips begins to VIBRATE.

Bloody hell.  What's happening?

RON

SSSSST!  A soft CRACKLING fills the car and FLAMES
bloom... in the hands of R.J. Lupin.  In the SHIVERING
LIGHT, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are
alert.  Wary.

Don't.  Move.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

A HAND -- slimy and scabbed -- a hand of death -- GRIPS
the half-open compartment door, pushes it aside.
REVEALS:  a TOWERING, CLOAKED FIGURE, its face hidden
beneath its black hood.  CROOKSHANKS' hair rises and as
she HISSES...

WHOOSHHHHH.  The folds of the hood TREMBLE.  A CHILL,
RATTLING INTAKE OF AIR is heard.  The FLAMES in Lupin's
hands SPUTTER.  A SOUND SWELLS in Harry's ears.  Eerie.
Painful.  The sound of a WOMAN SCREAMING.  Harry's eyes
roll up, eyelids fluttering.

And then... a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT drifts from his mouth.
The world spins off its axis and Harry falls... glasses
tumbling hard to the ground... then Harry... the muscles
of his jaw twitching.  THUNDER CRACKS.  LIGHTNING paints
the ICY windows...

WHITE.

BLACK.

With a DESPERATE GASP, Harry opens his eyes.  Blinks.
DUSK IS GONE.  The windows BLACK.  The floor at his spine
is SHAKING GENTLY.  The train moving again.  His eyes
shift, see a DROP OF WATER, newly unfrozen, running
slowly down the window.

Harry?  Harry, are you all right?

HERMIONE

Hermione's troubled face hovers above him.  He nods.
Sits up.  Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand.
Harry's glasses.

Thanks.

HARRY

Harry slips them on.  Discovers the cold sweat glazing
his brow.  SNAP!  Professor Lupin breaks a ragged
triangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands.  Holds
it out.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Chocolate.  Eat.  It'll help.

What was that -- that thing?

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

A Dementor.  One of the guards of
Azkaban.  It's gone now.

Harry frowns in confusion.

HERMIONE

It was searching the train, Harry.
For Sirius Black.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I need to have a word with the
driver.  Excuse me.

Eat.  It'll help.

As he leaves, Harry turns to Ron and Hermione.

RON

Well, you sort of went... rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a
fit or something.

HARRY

And did either of you?  You
know... pass out?

RON

No.  I felt... weird.  Like I'd
never be cheerful again.  But...
no.

Harry turns to Hermione.  She shakes her head.

HERMIONE

I was trembling.  Cold.  But
then... Professor Lupin made it go
away...

HARRY

But someone was screaming.  A
woman.

Hermione and Ron glance nervously at each other.

No one was screaming, Harry.

HERMIONE

Harry looks to the window and we PUSH IN ON his
REFLECTION.  It becomes a GLIMMERING PUDDLE and...

At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.  We TRACK
ALONG the FACES of the choir, singing to the strains of a
HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of
which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).

ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
side as red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet.  As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.

DUMBLEDORE

Welcome!  Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts!  I have a few things
to say, before we become befuddled
by our excellent feast.  I myself
am particularly looking forward to
the flaming kiwi cups, which,
while somewhat treacherous for
those of us with facial hair...

McGONAGALL clears her throat.

DUMBLEDORE

Mm.  Yes.  First, I'm pleased to
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who
has kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts.  Good luck to you,
Professor.

Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
LOUDLY.

HERMIONE

Of course!  That's why he knew to
give you the chocolate, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE

As some of you may know, Professor
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years,
has decided to retire in order to
spend more time with his remaining
limbs.  Fortunately, I'm delighted
to announce that his place will be
filled by none other than our own
Rubeus Hagrid!

Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other --
stunned -- then APPLAUD vigorously.  Hagrid turns ruby
red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending
water goblets weaving.

DUMBLEDORE
(turning grave)

Finally, on a more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request
of the Ministry of Magic -- will,
until further notice, play host to
the Dementors of Azkaban.

A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall.  At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever-
present CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feigns
a dead faint.

DUMBLEDORE

The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds.  While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself, you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities.  Under no
circumstances are you to approach
them.  It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving.

head playfully, CHIRP-CHIRP-CHIRPING merrily before it...

... flutters off, pin-wheeling past flowers, into a
BIRDBATH, finally coming to rest upon...

A crimson scrim FLUTTERS and SYBIL TRELAWNEY, Divination
Professor, glides dramatically INTO VIEW, eyes huge and
bug-like behind enormous glasses.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

... the Sight.  Hello.  I am
Professor Trelawney.  Together, we
shall cast ourselves into the
future.  But know this.  One
either has the Gift or not.  It
cannot be divined from the pages
of a book.  Books only cloud one's
Inner Eye.

What rubbish.

Ron spins.  Frowns at Hermione.

Where'd you come from?

RON

Me?  I've been here all along.

HERMIONE

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

You, boy!  Is your grandmother
well?

I... I think so.

NEVILLE

I wouldn't be so sure of that.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

(continuing)

The first term will be devoted to
the reading of tea leaves.  If all
goes well, we will proceed to
palmistry, fire omens, and
finally... the crystal ball.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

Unfortunately, classes will be
disrupted in February by a nasty
bout of flu.  I myself will lose
my voice.  And in late spring, one
of our number will... leave us
forever.

As the class exchanges uneasy glances, Trelawney smiles
brightly.

Well then.  Shall we?

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

CUT TO:

TEACUP - DETAIL - LATER

Inside, a CLOUD of TEA LEAVES mutates oddly.  Harry,
sitting opposite Ron now, frowns at the leaves, consults
the SYMBOLS in the textbook (Unfogging the Future) at his
elbow.  Trelawney walks amongst them, robes flowing.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Broaden your minds, my dears.  And
allow your eyes to see... beyond.

Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

A five-leaf clover... You can
expect to wake with a horrible
rash tomorrow morning, dear.

(then, casually)

Mr. Longbottom, after you've
broken your first cup...

CA-CHINK!  Neville fumbles the cup in his hands and the
brittle CRASH of CHINA is heard.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

... would you be so kind as to
select one of the blue ones?  I'm
rather partial to the pink.

(pausing by Ron)

What do you see in Mr. Potter's
cup, Mr. Weasley?

Well.  He's got a wonky sort of
cross -- that's trials and
suffering.  But this lot here

happiness.  So... he's going to
suffer but be very happy about it.

Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and
GASPS.

Ahhh!

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

PARVATI
What is it, Professor?

Trelawney regards Harry with a mixture of pity and fear.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
My dear boy... You have the Grim.

The Grin?  What's the Grin?

SEAMUS

Not the grin, you idiot.  The Grim.

PARVATI

But what does it mean, Professor?

DEAN THOMAS

'The Grim...'

LAVENDER

All turn, see Lavender bent over her textbook.

LAVENDER

'Taking the form of a giant
spectral dog, it is among the
darkest omens in our world.  It is
an omen... of death.'

Harry peers into his cup.  The tea leaves shift.  The dog
disappears.  And a new image emerges slowly...

Sirius Black.

That's a fascinating subject.

RON

Ancient Runes?  Exactly how many
classes are you taking this term?

A fair few.

HERMIONE

RON

Hang on.  Ancient Runes is the
same time as Divination.  You'd

comin' up.  Follow me.

EXT. PADDOCK - HAGRID'S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side
of the Forbidden Forest.  In the paddock, a freestanding
IRON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES.
Nearby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.

HAGRID

Gather 'round.  Find yerself a spot.
That's it.  Now, firs' thing yeh'll
want ter do is open yer books --

And exactly how do we do that?

DRACO

Hagrid looks.  Belts, rope, Spellotape:  any means
available have been employed to bridle The Monster Book
of Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.

HAGRID

Crikey.  Didn' yeh know?  All yeh've
got ter do is stroke 'em.  Look --

Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape
binding it.  As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a
forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS.
Falls quietly open.

Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.

HAGRID

Righ' then.  So... so... yeh've
got yer books, an' now yeh need
the Magical Creatures.  Right.
So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.

Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees.  Draco shakes
his head, SPEAKS LOUDLY to Crabbe and Goyle.

DRACO

God, this place is going to the
dogs.  Wait until my father hears
Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching
classes.

Listen, you stupid prat --

HARRY

Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.

DRACO

Potter, there's a Dementor behind
you.

Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing.  Instantly,
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, then
break up laughing.  Harry reddens, embarrassed, then...

A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees.  It
has the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the
front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle.  The
students step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooing
the beast on.

HAGRID

Gee up, there!

(grinning)
Beau'iful, isn' he?

(CONTINUED)

44

CONTINUED:  (2)

There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless.  As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.

Hagrid.  Exactly what is that?

RON

HAGRID

A Hippogriff, o' course.  Now,
firs' thing yeh gotta know is
they're proud.  Easily offended,
Hippogriffs are.  Don't never
insult one, 'cause it migh' be
the las' thing yeh do.  Right
then -- who wants ter come an'
say hello?

The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.

Good man, Harry!

HAGRID

Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.

HAGRID

Tha's it.  Easy now... stop!  This
here's Buckbeak, Harry.  Yeh want
ter let 'im make the firs' move.
It's polite, see?  Jus' take step
forward, give 'im a bow, and if
Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
ter touch him.  Ready?

Unsure, Harry nods anyway.  Steps forward.  And... bows.
Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily.
Harry waits.  And waits...

Back off, Harry!  Back off!

HAGRID

Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks his
beak.  Hagrid sighs, relieved.

HAGRID

Well done, Harry!  Go on.  Give
'im a pat.

Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on
Buckbeak's fierce beak.  The class CLAPS.  Harry
smiles.

HAGRID

Look at that!  I reckon he migh'

HARRY

Excuse me?

HAGRID

We'll jus' set yeh behind the
wing joint.  Mind yeh don' pull
any feathers out.  He won' like
that.

Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's
back, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's
hindquarters.

Off yeh go!

HAGRID

As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! --
they SOAR into the air.  Rising higher.  And higher.
And higher.

Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck.
Losing himself in the joy of flying.  Smiling at the
sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the
grass below.  Circling over the Whomping Willow, past
Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stopping
speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly.  Hagrid WHISTLES then, and
Buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock,
galloping to a halt.  As Harry slides off, the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes
maliciously.

HAGRID

Good work, Harry!

(under his breath)
How'm I doin' me firs' day?

Brilliant... Professor.

HARRY

They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly,
strides toward Buckbeak.

Give me a go at that thing.  If
Potter can do it, it must be
easy.  You're not dangerous at

brute --

Malfoy!  No!

HAGRID

In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN.  Malfoy
freezes.  Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his
robes.  SHRIEKS.  Instantly, Harry dashes forward.
Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them.  Ducks its beak.  Harry...
realizing what he's done... breathes.

DRACO

It's killed me!  It's killed
me!

HAGRID

Calm yerself!  Yer fine... jus'
a scratch...

Hagrid looks:  a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp
arm.

HERMIONE

Hagrid.  He's got to be taken to
a hospital.  I'll go with you,
if you like --

HAGRID

No.  I'm the teacher.  You all...
you all just... Class dismissed!

And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up
Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers
toward the castle.

INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

As Lavender and Parvati huddle over a DOZEN TEACUPS,

At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.

over a copy of The Daily Prophet.

Who?

But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides a
chilling answer:  Sirius Black.  Hermione reads over the
shoulders of others.  WHISPERS half to herself:

Boggart.  Let's practice it now,

Riddikulus!

DRACO

It's this class that's ridiculous.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Good.  So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone
is not enough.  What really

laughter.  You need to force it
to assume a shape you find truly
amusing.  Neville, come up here,

Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward
queasily.

What would you say is the thing
that frightens you most?

NEVILLE

She carries a red handbag...

PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's fine.  We don't need to
hear it.  If you see it, we will.
Now, when I open this wardrobe,
Neville, here's what I want you to
do...

Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS.  Neville's eyes
POP OPEN in shock.  Consider Lupin uncertainly.

You can do this, Neville.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Right then.  Wand at the ready.
One.  Two.  Three!

SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and
the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN.  Instantly, Snape appears, eyes
flashing hideously as he stalks forward.  Neville backs
away in fright.

Think, Neville.  Think!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

R-r-riddikulus!

reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING
MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG.  Instantly, the
class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins).
Neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself.

Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE.  As a
SCRATCHY RHUMBA fills the room, he points to Ron.

Snape DISSOLVES into a mad whirling mass, then mutates
into a... GIANT SPIDER.  As Ron GASPS, Harry and Hermione
exchange an uncertain glance.  Lupin puts his hands on
Ron's shoulders to steady him.  Ron raises his wand.

Riddikulus!

RON

CRACK!  ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy
feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place.
Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings out.

Parvati!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

As Parvati steps up, the spider SPINS faster and faster,
a DIZZYING BLUR, then reappears as a VAMPIRE.

Riddikulus!

PARVATI

As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT
BEHIND... so our POV is of the students.  SWISH!  The
cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we REVERSE again...
see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA.
As it begins to SHIMMY about -- against its will -- the
class starts to CLAP.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Mr. Thomas!
As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched
SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.

Riddikulus!

DEAN THOMAS

The cobra's hooded head BOBS back and forth, transforms
into a JACK-IN-THE-BOX.  Lupin grins and...

Next!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

flickers through Lupin's face.  The Jack-In-The-Box
pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry,
becoming more sinister, transforming into a...

... Dementor.  Suddenly the MUSIC FADES.  Harry starts to
raise his wand, then... freezes, transfixed.  The
Dementor looms closer and closer, when...

... Lupin steps between, snaps his wand.

Here!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST
appears, which becomes CLOUDS.  Something glows within
the clouds, white, silvery and round...

Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

POP!  The orb deflates like a punctured balloon, WHIZZES
crazily about the room, then darts back into the
wardrobe.  The door SLAMS SHUT and the CLASS CHEERS.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done, everyone.  I think
that's enough excitement for today.

As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry,
subdued, remains behind.  At the doorway, Lupin glances
back, exchanges a private glance with him.  As he exits,
the WARDROBE gives one last RATTLE.

EXT. CLOCK TOWER COURTYARD - MORNING (TWO WEEKS LATER)

A great buzzing queue of STUDENTS -- Third Years and
older -- each clutching a PERMISSION FORM -- pass by a
glowering Filch.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Remember!  These visits to
Hogsmeade Village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect
poorly on the school in any way,
that privilege shall not be
extended again.

Harry approaches her, but before he can utter a syllable:

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

No permission form.  No visiting
the Village.  That's the rule,
Potter.

HARRY

Yes, Professor, but I thought if
you said I could go --

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

But I don't say so.  A parent or
guardian must sign, and since I am
neither, it would be
inappropriate.

(a flicker of pity)

I'm sorry, Potter.  But that's my
final word.

Ron and Hermione -- watching Harry expectantly from
across the way -- see him turn, shake his head.  Their
faces fall.  Harry raises his hand in farewell.  Watches
them go.

So.  No Hogsmeade, eh ?

No.  I was just trying to make you

HARRY

Professor, can I ask you
something?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

You'd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart.

(off Harry's surprise)

I should think it'd be obvious.  I
assumed the Boggart would take the
shape of Lord Voldemort.

Harry frowns.  Lupin studies him curiously.

But clearly... I was wrong.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HARRY

I did think of Voldemort first.
But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the
Dementors...

 (CONTINUED)
PROFESSOR LUPIN

Well, well.  I'm impressed.  That
suggests that what you fear most
of all is... fear. Very wise.

HARRY

Before I fainted... I heard
something.  A woman.  Screaming.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Dementors force us to relive the
worst memories of our lives.  Our
pain becomes their power.

HARRY

I think it was my mother.  The
night she was murdered.

Harry looks up.  Finds Lupin studying him.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

The first time I saw you, Harry, I
recognized you immediately.  Not
by your scar.  By your eyes.
They're your mother Lily's.

(nodding)

Yes.  I knew her.  She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was.  We used to talk for hours.
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman.  She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met, even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldn't see it in themselves...

Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father.  James
had, shall we say, a certain
talent for trouble.  A gift, rumor
has it, he passed on to you.

Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately.  Harry smiles
vaguely.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents,
Harry -- but know this...

(eyeing Harry intensely)

They lived.  Every moment of every
day.  You should know that.
That's how they'd want to be
remembered.

INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER)

The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap
stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all
shapes, sizes and colors into the air.  A MARIONETTE of a
HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its
limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend
from Neville's fingertips.  Seamus passes his hand
through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin
collapses.

RON

And Honeyduke's is brilliant!
Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees --
and blood-flavored lollipops for
Halloween!

Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray of
brilliantly colored sweets on the table.  Hermione
notices.

HERMIONE

But, I mean, after awhile, it got
a bit boring.  Don't you think,
Ron?

RON

Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Dead depressing.
Hang on.  I almost forgot.  I got
you something wicked at Dervish
and Banges.  It's a Pocket
Sneakoscope.

Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.

RON

If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's meant to light up
and spin.  Mind you, Fred and
George say it's rubbish, sold for
wizard tourists, but I thought,
you know, it can't
hurt, given that...

Sirius Black's trying to kill me.

HARRY

Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.

HARRY

I'm glad you had a good time.
Really.  And thanks for this.

Rubbish or not, you're right.  It

Let me through, please.  Excuse
me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...

(stopping dead)

Back!  All of you!  No one is to

been fully searched!

Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances, when...
Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.

The Fat Lady... she's gone.

GINNY

RON

Probably stuffing her face with
the apples in that still life on
the second floor again.

No.  You don't understand --

GINNY

Hermione GASPS.  GRABS Harry's arm.  He looks.  SEES:
The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great
strips of canvas hanging from the frame.  Just then,
Dumbledore appears.

DUMBLEDORE

Mr. Filch.  Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle for the Fat Lady.

Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows,
then... narrow.

FILCH

There'll be no need for
ghosts, Professor...

Filch extends a crooked finger.  High up, near the
ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own,
trembling.

Dear lady.  Who did this to you?

DUMBLEDORE

FAT LADY
(in a trance)

Eyes like the devil he's got.  And
a soul as dark as his name.  It
was him, Headmaster.  The one they
talk about.  He's here.  Somewhere
in the castle.  Sirius Black.

As the students REACT, Dumbledore's VOICE cuts through.

Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.  The
rest of you... to the Great Hall.

Headmaster.  No sign of Black.
Nor anywhere else in the castle.

DUMBLEDORE

(nodding)

I didn't really expect him to
linger.

SNAPE

Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts castle on one's
own, completely undetected...

Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the
bait.

SNAPE

You may recall, prior to the start
of term, I did express my concerns
when you appointed Professor --

DUMBLEDORE
I do not believe a single
professor inside this castle
would have helped Sirius
Black enter it, Severus.

As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over
the slumbering students.

DUMBLEDORE

No... I feel quite confident the
castle is safe.  And I'm more than
willing to let the students return
to their Houses.  But tomorrow.
For now, let them sleep...

As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes,
feigns sleep.

It's astonishing what the body can
endure when the mind allows itself

The Fat Lady has been replaced by a PAINTING of a TINY

as a group of Gryffindors regard him warily.

SIR CADOGAN

Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan!
Back, you scurvy braggarts!  You

He's barking mad!

SEAMUS

As Neville holds up a wrinkled piece of parchment, Harry,
Ron and Hermione begin to exit.

As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy
finishes SCRAWLING something on a bit of PARCHMENT and
balls it up in his hands.  As he opens them, a MOTH
flutters from his palms.

HARRY

Excuse me, sir, but... where's
Professor Lupin?

SNAPE

That's not really your concern, is
it, Potter?  Suffice it to say,
your Professor finds himself
incapable of teaching at the
present time.  Page 394.

Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE
SHOW BEGINS.  An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST
flickers at the front of the room.  Ron frowns down at
his book.

Werewolves?

RON

HERMIONE

But, sir, we've only just begun
learning about Red Caps and
Hinkypunks.  We're not meant to
start nocturnal beasts for

When did she come in?  Did you see
her come in...

SNAPE

Now.  Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf?

WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to
respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry.

Malfoy's PARCHMENT has reappeared.

No one?  How... disappointing.

SNAPE

HERMIONE

Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal.  A werewolf has no choice in the matter.
Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind --
Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.

SNAPE

Quiet, Malfoy!  Though one must
admit to feeling your pain.  That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn, Miss Granger.  Tell
me.  Are you incapable of
restraining yourself?  Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all?

RON
(to Harry)

He's got a point, you know.

Harry stares at the parchment.  Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over.

SNAPE

Five points from Gryffindor!

(to the class)

As a antidote to your ignorance, I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning,
with particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it.

(suddenly)

Passing notes, Potter?

Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose.  Eyes
it.

Not exactly Picasso, are you?  I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist.

free, soaring end over end into the sky, the...

... CROWD EXPLODES and two Quidditch squads -- Gryffindor
in SCARLET, Hufflepuff in CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the
air.  Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward, and the match is on.

We CUT INTO Harry, rising like a rocket through the mist,
his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY  in the wind.

INTERCUT HARRY'S POV

-- as he flies, RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him,
every dark cloud concealing potential danger.  Beaters
crisscross his path.  A BLUDGER WHIZZES past, then a
second ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM.

SWOOP! -- Harry ducks, watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the
BROOM of a HUFFLEPUFF BEATER.  The Beater goes into a
wild spiral, vanishes in the mist.

Ron squints upward, the players little more than
STREAKING BLURS from his vantage.  KA-SSSST!  A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch.  Ron
looks down at his own HAND.  In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR,
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.

In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below.  Suddenly, in
the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL.  For a moment, it sails wondrously
through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
WHOOP!  WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET.  Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds.  Then...

... something GLIMMERS:  the Snitch.  Instantly, Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball,
chasing it through one cloud... then another... and
another... until...

... he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky... only to find
the Snitch is gone.  Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back
around, searching the horizon frantically, when he spies
something:

In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
veil of mist.

Harry turns.  In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
INTO VIEW, harpoons a player.  Harry's eyes shift.  The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of
a cloud.  Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed.  As this mist closes,
Harry frowns, jets away.

As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET, ROARING.  Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on.

Come on!  Faster!

HARRY

The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he closes
on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out...
when...

rain is turning to needles.  Needles of ice.  Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK.  The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING.  VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose.

SWOOSH!  A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right.  He
turns.  SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
Harry sees neither.  Looks down.  The layers of mist are
parting below.  LIGHTNING STRIKES.  Reveals:  an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch.  A vast legion of
them...

DEMENTORS.

A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch,
not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM.  A WOMAN'S SCREAM.
Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth.  His glasses glaze over completely.
His fingers, rigid, can no longer grip the broom and...

He FALLS.

No!!!

HERMIONE

Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.

The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents,
then drops... right into the Whomping Willow.

FLOOMPH!  Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud,
then another.  Plummeting through the circling Dementors.

Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd.  Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens.  Eyes angry but clear.
Dumbledore.

An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air.

A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky.

Why do they affect me so,
Professor?  I mean, more than
everyone else...

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory, until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences.  You're not weak,
Harry.  The Dementors affect you
most, because there are true
horrors in your past.  Horrors
your classmates can scarcely
imagine.  You have nothing to be
ashamed of.

But we've decided your need's
greater than ours.  George, if you
will...

GEORGE

I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.

George touches his wand to the parchment and INTRICATE
INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like
veins.  Harry reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top:

HARRY

'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs are proud to present
The Marauder's Map'...?

GEORGE

Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and
Prongs.  We owe them so much.

Oh.  And, Harry?  When you're

and say, 'Mischief managed.'
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry approaches a STATUE of a hump-backed, ONE-EYED
WITCH.

INSERT MAP -- Harry traces his finger along the tattered
surface to an INK FIGURE labeled "Harry Potter."  A tiny
SPEECH BUBBLE appears:  "Dissendium."

Dissendium?

HARRY

CLICK!  The witch's EYE OPENS and the statue pivots,
revealing a DARK OPENING in the floor.  As Harry
crouches, squinting, a cool DRAFT OF AIR ruffles his hair
and the CAMERA DRIFTS INTO the DARKNESS...

A tiny LIGHT bobs in the distance, fracturing the

Harry stops, cranes his neck.  STONE STEPS.  Taps the map.

CRATES.  HUGE ROLLING BINS.  A WOOD STAIRCASE.  A
trapdoor lifts.  Harry's eyes appear.  As he pulls
himself up, a DOOR BANGS OPEN.  Dense CHATTER ROARS from
above.  Quickly, Harry hides, watches a MAN'S BOOTS
descend the stairs.  Then...

WOMAN (O.S.)

A box of Jelly Slugs as well,
Horace.  We're nearly cleared out.

HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes.  Harry looks up to
the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak...

77

INT. HONEYDUKE'S SWEETSHOP - SAME TIME - DAY

The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears.  We

fingers and out the door...

As the lollipop drifts on, FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow
below...

EXT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DAY (LATER)

At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating
veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the
gloom.  Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as
best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically,
they're scared stiff.

HERMIONE

It's meant to be the most haunted

Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the
rise, phantoms in the mist.  Malfoy.  Crabbe.  Goyle.
Pike.

DRACO

Well, well.  Look who's here.  You
two shopping for your dream home?
Seems a bit grand for you, Weasel-
Bee.  Don't your family all sleep
in one room?

Shut your mouth, Malfoy.

RON

DRACO

(clucking his tongue)
Now that's not very friendly.
Boys, I think we're going to have
to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his
superiors.

HERMIONE

(a harsh chuckle)

Hope you don't mean yourself.

Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust.

DRACO

How dare you speak to me, you
filthy, little mud --

SPLAT!  Malfoy takes a SNOWBALL to the grill.  Splutters:

Who did that!

DRACO

Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT!
SPLAT! -- he takes two more.  Hermione and Ron glance
about uneasily.

Well, don't just stand there!

DRACO

Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when --
FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst
into the snow.  Draco begins to back away fearfully,
eying the mist...

DRACO

Wait a minute, there's something
out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!

Malfoy's SKI MASK is pulled over his eyes, he's spun
about, given a ROUGH KICK to the ass and sent stumbling
over the rise and out of sight.  Instantly, Crabbe and
Goyle join him.

Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance,
and... DASH OFF... when -- FLUMPH! -- they both go
flying, land on their pants in the snow.  As they sit up,
they hear...

LAUGHTER.  Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.

Harry...?  Harry?

HERMIONE

The Invisibility Cloak drops.  Sure enough.  Harry.
Grinning.

RON

Bloody hell, Harry!  That was not
funny!

But he's smiling.  They all are.  As he and Hermione pelt
Harry with SNOWBALLS, we --

CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY (MOMENTS

The trio trudge through the SWIRLING SNOW.  Harry's
donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise
himself.

RON

Those weasels!  Never told me
about any Marauder's Map!

HERMIONE

But Harry isn't going to keep it.
He's going to turn it over to
Professor McGonagall, aren't you?

HERMIONE

Rosmerta, m'dear!

CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)

Up ahead Cornelius Fudge emerges from a MINISTRY SLEIGH
as Hagrid swings the door clear and -- with unfortunate
ease -- rips it clean off the fittings.  Fudge joins
McGonagall and a CURVY BARMAID (ROSMERTA) outside the
THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB.

HERMIONE

That's Madam Rosmerta.  Ron
fancies her.

It's not true!

Shhh.

RON

HARRY

I trust business is good?

CORNELIUS FUDGE

MADAM ROSMERTA

It'd be a right sight better if
the Ministry wasn't sending
Dementors into my pub every other
night.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.

He's gone.  FOOTPRINTS track through the snow, into the pub.

INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - HARRY'S POV FROM UNDER THE
INVISIBILITY CLOAK - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

81

... as he THREADS THROUGH the teeming pub, PAST a SIGN
("No Underage Wizards") and nearly collides with some
very STRANGE-LOOKING PATRONS.  Ron and Hermione ripple
briefly past a frosted window, then... THREE SHRUNKEN
HEADS swing INTO VIEW.

SHRUNKEN HEAD #1

So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned.
 Don't want to go losing your head!'

As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and
down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
toward Harry's eyes.  Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!
-- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured
DARTBOARD behind him.
Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK
STAIRWELL as Rosmerta leads them into a small BACK ROOM.
As the door starts to close, Harry rushes forward:  SLAM!
Too late.  CAMERA TILTS.  The KNOB turns, the door
opens...

INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - CARD ROOM - DAY

... and SNOW flutters off the sill of a HALF-OPEN WINDOW.
McGonagall turns, frowning, and re-closes the door,
harder this time, then joins Fudge and Rosmerta.  HARRY'S
POV SHIFTS FROM one TO the other as they speak.

MADAM ROSMERTA
Come on then.  Let's hear it.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Years ago, when Harry Potter's
parents were marked for death,
they went into hiding.  Few knew
where they were.  One who did was
black.  And he told...

MADAM ROSMERTA

You-Know-Who.  I've heard this
rot.  It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day.  And I'll
say now what I said then:  Of all
the boys I ran out of here,
Black's the last who would've gone
over to the dark side.  Hearsay.
That's all the Ministry had.
Hearsay.

Ha!  Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!

CORNELIUS FUDGE

Peter Pettigrew?

MADAM ROSMERTA

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Little lump of a boy?  Always
tagging after Black and...

MADAM ROSMERTA

I remember him.  What's he got to
do with it?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

After the Potters were killed,
Pettigrew went looking for Black.
And, unfortunately... found him.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

Black was vicious.  He didn't kill
Pettigrew.  He destroyed him.  A
finger.  That's all that was left.
A finger -- there's your hearsay.

Rosmerta looks to McGonagall.  She nods grimly.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters, but he's the
reason they're dead.  And now he
wants to finish what he started.

Harry.

MADAM ROSMERTA

McGonagall nods, then looks pained.

67.

82

But that's not the worst of it.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

What could be worse?

MADAM ROSMERTA

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

This:  Sirius Black was and
remains today... Harry Potter's
godfather.

BLAM!  The pub doors fly open, REVEAL Main Street, where
Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the
chill.  As they look down, CAMERA TILTS...

83

EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - MOMENTS LATER -
DAY

... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow.  HARRY'S POV ENDS.
CAMERA TILTS UP, FOLLOWS Hermione and Ron until they
LEAVE FRAME, then HOLDS ON a POSTER of BLACK, fluttering
against a lamppost:  "Have you seen this wizard?"

84

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

84

At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and
SOBS are heard.  Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging
her from going further, but she does, filling the
footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently
-- drawing the cloak from Harry.  He stares into the
mist, eyes stinging with tears.

HARRY

He was their friend.  And he
betrayed them.  He was their
friend.

(eyes hardening)

I hope he finds me.  But when he
does, I'm going to be ready.  When
he does, I'm going to kill him.

85

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (TRANSITION TO SPRING)

Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn.  The GIANT
SQUID breaks through the last GLAZE of ICE on the Black
Lake.  The Whomping Willow shakes the water from its
branches...

86

INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK

68.

86

The DYING SUN streams through high windows, painting
Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin.  ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently.  Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic.  Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.

HARRY

If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.

Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Very well.  The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm.  Ever hear of it?

Harry shakes his head.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

A Patronus is a kind of positive
force.  For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield.  The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.

Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY.  As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
back.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory.  And not
just any.  This memory needs to be
a very happy one.  And powerful.

Harry thinks a bit.  Then... nods.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Got something?  Good.  Let it fill
you up.  Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum.  Without your
wand...

HARRY
Expecto Patronum...

(CONTINUED)

86

CONTINUED:

69.

86

Right then.  Shall we?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry nods, raises his wand.  Lupin, watching closely,
reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Concentrate, Harry.
Concentrate...

As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES.  In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.

Expecto... Patronum...

HARRY

The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber.  A SCREAM ECHOES distantly.  Harry's hand
trembles.  His eyes begin to roll up...

Expecto... Expecto...

HARRY

Here!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.

Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case.  Harry stands blinking.  Dazed.  Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket.  Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.

Quickly.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry studies the frog.  Takes a bite.  Begins to
recover.

That's one nasty Dementor.

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Boggart, Harry.  The real thing
would be much, much worse.  Just
out of interest, what were you
thinking of?  What memory did you
choose?

The first time I rode a broom.

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's not good enough, Harry.
Not nearly.

Harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.

HARRY

There's another.  It's not happy
exactly.  I mean, it is.  It's the
happiest I've ever felt.  But
it's... complicated.

Is it strong?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes.  Emotional.  Nods.

Then let's try it.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry takes a breath.  Tosses the frog aside.  Poises
himself.

Think, Harry, think --

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Just do it!

HARRY

Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness.  Opens the
packing case.  Instantly, the Dementor appears again.  A
chill fills the air.  The hair skates off Harry's scar.
He sets his jaw...

Expecto Patronum!

HARRY

Harry's hand TREMBLES.  His whole BODY TREMBLES.  But he
holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him and
the Dementor.  The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like
water...

Riddikulus!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

CRACK!  The Dementor vanishes.  Harry's arm drops.
Slack.  Lupin eyes Harry with a kind of awe.  His voice
barely a WHISPER.

(CONTINUED)

86

CONTINUED:  (3)

Well done.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HARRY

I think I've had enough.  For
today.

71.

86

Lupin nods.  Watches Harry move to the door.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

So you know, Harry:  You'd have
given your father a run for his
money.  And, believe me, that's
saying something.

Harry ponders this.  Then speaks, deep inside himself.

HARRY

I was thinking of him.  And Mum.
Seeing their faces.  They're just
talking to me.  Just... talking.
That was the memory I chose.  I
don't even know if it's real...

Harry grips the door, pushes past.

But it's the best I have.

parents...

Harry BOLTS UP, sees a SILHOUETTE etched on the window --
a MAN CLUTCHING A KNIFE.  All the boys are up now.
Screaming.  Amid the chaos, Harry grabs his wand.

Everybody out!

HARRY

The others flee.  Harry faces the HULKING SHADOW, wand
poised.

Show yourself.

HARRY

Crash!  The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor and
Scabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased by
Crookshanks.  Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasps
the curtains and swings through the open window, plunging
into the night.  Harry rushes to the window, looks down.

The entire Gryffindor House, in pajamas, stand before
McGonagall, who wears a TARTAN ROBE and an expression of
singular irritation.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That's preposterous, Weasley.  How
could Sirius Black possibly have
got through the portrait hole?

RON

I don't know how he got in!  I was
a bit busy dodging his knife!

Just then, a curiously content Crookshanks wends his way
through Ron's legs.

And this bloody cat ate my rat!

RON

That's a lie!

HERMIONE

It is not and you bloody well know it!

RON

Silence!

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

McGonagall turns then and everyone follows her eye to Sir
Cadogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.

DUMBLEDORE

Sir Cadogan.  Is it possible that
you let a mysterious man enter
Gryffindor Tower tonight?

SIR CADOGAN

Certainly, good lady!  He had the
password.  Had the whole week's,
in fact.  On a little piece of
paper.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Which abysmally foolish person
wrote down the passwords and then
proceeded to lose them!

Every eye shifts once more:  Neville.  McGonagall sighs.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Longbottom?

While we know Sirius Black is gone

time, attempt to return.  Let me
be clear.  You are not to move
about the castle alone.  And you
are not to write down the
password!  Understood!

A collective nod of the head.  McGonagall gives the ties
of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits.

Very well then.  Go to bed.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glance
toward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.

I could've killed him.

cat!  I've got few other things on
my mind right now!

RON

Really?  Wasn't you had to roll
under the bed last night to avoid

Ron stops, wishes he could take it back.  They all wish
he could.  Avoiding each other's eyes, they turn,
continue on.

Hagrid, wearing a GIGANTIC, HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhaps
the world's ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE, stands knee-
deep in the shallows of the Black Lake, skimming rocks as
big as flagstones across the water's shiny gloss.  As he
turns, the trio catches a brief sight of his eyes, red
with tears, then he looks away.

How'd it go, Hagrid?

HERMIONE

Buckbeak liked London.

HAGRID

I meant the hearing.

HERMIONE

HAGRID

Oh.  That.  Well, I got up an'
said my bit -- You know, how
Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an'
as long as yeh treated 'im with

HAGRID

Buckbeak's not going back to the
forest...

HERMIONE

slumber, Harry lies awake, unable to sleep.  Finally, he
turns to his cupboard, takes the Marauder's Map.
WHISPERS:

HARRY

I solemnly swear that I am up to

The crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of
Hogwarts radiate across the parchment, then... a TINY DOT
catches Harry's eye.  He frowns.  It reads:  "Peter
Pettigrew."

Harry moves down a DARK corridor, map in hand, WAND

SOFTLY.
INSERT - MARAUDER'S MAP

"Harry Potter" and "Peter Pettigrew" draw closer and
closer.

BACK TO SCENE

Harry squints toward the end of the corridor.  Down at
the map.  Pettigrew moves quickly down the adjoining
corridor.  Twenty yards away.  Ten.  Only seconds away...

Wand trembling in his hand, Harry glances from the map to
the dark corridor ahead, again and again.  Then... as the
two DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up...
turns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets...

HIMSELF

... reflected in a MIRROR.  He BLINKS, startled, then
glances back down at the map.  Pettigrew has moved past
him.  Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along the
walls.

Watch it there, boy!

VOICE (O.S.)

Harry JUMPS.  But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING,
scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light.  On the map,
"Pettigrew" continues to move away.  Harry makes to
follow, then stops.  HEARS FOOTSTEPS.  The WAND'S SPOT
dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.
Approaching FAST:  ”Severus Snape."

Mischief managed!

HARRY

Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and
turns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.

SNAPE

Potter.  What're you doing

was exceedingly arrogant.
Strutting about the castle --

HARRY

My dad didn’t strut.  Nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
appreciate you lowering your wand.

Snape eyes Harry coldly.  Containing himself.  Lowers his
wand.

Turn out your pockets.

SNAPE

Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.

Turn out your pockets!

SNAPE

Finally, Harry obliges.  Seeing the map, Snape's eyes
glitter.

And this.  What might it be?

SNAPE

Spare bit of parchment...

HARRY

SNAPE

Really...

(poising his wand)

Reveal your secret!

To Harry's horror, words begin to appear.  Snape studies
him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips.  Turns the map
his way.

Read it.

SNAPE

HARRY

'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...'

Go on.

SNAPE

'... and request that he keep his
abnormally large nose out of other
people's business.'

SNAPE

(smile drooping)

Why you insolent little --

Professor...?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Snape turns.  Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.

SNAPE

Well, well.  Lupin.  Out for a little
walk in the moonlight, are we?

Harry?  You all right?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

SNAPE

That remains to be seen.  I've
just now confiscated a rather
curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
Take a look, Lupin.  This is
supposed to be your area of
expertise.

Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather
unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.

Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.

SNAPE

PROFESSOR LUPIN

I seriously doubt that, Severus.
It looks to me as if it merely
insults anyone who tries to read
it.  I suspect it's a Zonko
product.  Nevertheless, I shall
pursue any hidden qualities it may
possess.  As you say, it's my area
of expertise.  Come, Harry.

101

INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN'S OFFICE - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map
fiercely.

(CONTINUED)

101

CONTINUED:

101

PROFESSOR LUPIN

I don't know how this map came to
be in your possession, Harry, but
I'm astounded that you didn't turn
it in.  Did you ever stop to think
that this -- in the hands of
Sirius Black -- is a map to you?

Harry walks silently.  Lupin can barely contain his anger.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Your father didn't set much store
by rules either.  But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours.  Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected, with a killer
on the loose, strikes me as a poor
way to repay them.  I won't cover
up for you again, Harry.

Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, and
begins to sort through some papers.  Harry lingers
briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON
that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn
away.  Stops.

HARRY

Professor.  Just so you know, I
don't think the map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the
castle.  Someone I know to be dead.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
(only half-listening)

And who was that, Harry?

Peter Pettigrew.

HARRY

Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his
papers.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Very well.  I'd like you to return
to your dormitory now.  Oh, and
Harry?  Don't take any detours.

As Harry looks back, Lupin taps the map.

If you do.  I'll know.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Relax... Let your mind... go...

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY (V.O.)

102

INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING

102

The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting
the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made
of smoke.
Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Crystal-gazing requires that you
clear the Inner Eye.  Only then,
will you... See.  Oh my, what do
we have here...?

As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her
eyes.

HERMIONE

Here we go again.  It's the Grim!
It's the Grim!

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

(eyes narrowing)

My dear, from the moment you first
arrived in my class, I sensed that
you did not possess the proper
spirit for the noble art of
Divination.  You may be young in
years, but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave.

Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably --
seems incapable of a single word.  Rising gracelessly,
she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor.  Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the
doorway...

LAVENDER

'In late spring, one of our number
will leave us forever!'  You knew,
Professor!  You saw.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
On these occasions, I take no joy
in my gift, Miss Brown.

As the students exit, Ron, walking separately from Harry,
turns to Neville.

RON

She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always
mental, but now it's out in the
open for everyone to see...

Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off.  Harry
watches him go, along with the others, then spies
Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing.

102B

INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

102B

Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts
to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
DARKENS.  Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that
appears.  It is unmistakable:  Sirius Black.  Just then,
a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...

... a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder.  He wheels,
finds...

Professor Trelawney --

HARRY

He will return tonight....

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

Harry stiffens.  Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.

S-sorry?

HARRY

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY

Tonight, when the clock strikes
twelve, the servant shall break
free.  He and his Master shall be
reunited.  It cannot be prevented.

Trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward.
When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon
Harry's shoulder.  Her hand.

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
So sorry, dear boy.  Did you say
something?

Her voice is normal once more.  Harry shakes his head.

No.  Nothing.

HARRY

SWOOK!  SWOOK!  We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as

HERMIONE

I can't believe they're going to

HARRY
It just got worse.

She and Ron look and SEE:

106

EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - LATE
AFTERNOON

106

Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a
grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand,
spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak.  Hagrid wipes his eyes,
lopes into the hut.

DRACO

Did you see the big, fat
blubbering oaf?!  Oh, this is
going to be rich.  Did I tell you,
Father said I can keep the head --

Ah.  Come to see the show?

Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose,
when...

Hermione!  No!

RON

She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her.  He looks away.

RON
He's not worth it.

Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning,
lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat
on his back.  Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs,
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind.

That felt good.

HERMIONE

The trio makes their way down the slope and past
Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.

INT. HAGRID'S HUT - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK)

Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak.  Harry and
Ron sit.  Hermione makes tea.

HAGRID

Look at 'em.  Loves the smell
o' the trees when the wind
blows...

I say we set him free.

HARRY

HAGRID

(shaking his head)

They'd know I did it.  And tha'

Great man, Dumbledore.

Yeh will not!  Think I wan' yeh

Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off.
But before yeh do -- I wan' ter

Harry.

Ron and Harry exchange a glance, then look to Hagrid.

HAGRID

Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin
betw'n you two?  Go on now...

Reluctantly, Harry and Ron extend their hands.  Shake.

HAGRID

Good.  Now then.  Ron, I wan' ter
see you give Hermione a hug.

What!

HERMIONE/RON

HAGRID

Go on!  You two've been at it all
year.  An' I'm sick o' it.

Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and
perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever
seen.

HAGRID

Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most
pathetic hug I e'er seen.  But yeh
did it, an' tha's wha' matters.
There's jus' one other thing...

RON

I'm not kissing Fang if that's
what you're thinking...

Hearing his name, FANG -- Hagrid's giant boarhound --
THUMPS his tail happily on the floor.  Hagrid turns,
takes the lid from a FLOUR TIN, A TINY HEAD, ears flecked
with powder, emerges.

Scabbers!  You're alive!

RON

RON

Right.  Next time I see
Crookshanks, I'll let him know.

I meant me.

HERMIONE

Crikey.  Here we go agin...

HAGRID

SMASH!  A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS.  As Hermione
scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE
bounces off the back of Harry's head.

Ow!

HARRY

Harry turns, looks out the window.

Hagrid...

HARRY

Everyone turns.  Looks.  Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
Behind them, in a fluttering shroud of CROWS, the
Executioner follows, axe at his side.  Hagrid begins to
panic.

HAGRID

Yeh got to go!  It's almost dark.
Anyone sees yeh outside the castle
it'll be trouble!  Big trouble!
'Specially you, Harry --

BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  The door SHAKES.  Hagrid stiffens in
fear.  Harry reaches up, puts his finger to Hagrid's
trembling lips, speaks softly to the others.

C'mon.

HARRY

A veil of crows flutters onto the roof.  More drop into
the patch, begin to slowly circle Buckbeak.

Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch
Hagrid solemnly greet the others.  Fudge appears at the
window.  Picks his nose.  Just then, a Shhh!  is heard.
Hermione turns.  The branches of the trees behind her are
DANCING ODDLY.

What?

HARRY

HERMIONE

Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

110

EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

110

The trio slip silently into a stand of trees.  Beyond
them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.

DING!

DING!

DING!

The trio stops, fighting their tears.  A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut.  One of the SHADOWS --
Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points, directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak.  Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance,
then -- CAW!  CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES.

DING!

All goes very still.  The wind loses its voice...

DING!

Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees,
INTO VIEW...

DING!

The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky,
then drops from sight.  A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
disbelief.  Hermione, face turned away, trembles...

(CONTINUED)

110

CONTINUED:

DING!

88.

110

The SUN sets, dropping behind the mountains in the
distance.  Hermione turns.  Sees a frenzied spray of
crows stain the bloody sky, their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse.

Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger, drops like a tear...

DING!

Ron stares at his hand.  At the blood running down his
finger.

He bit me...

RON

His eyes shift.  See Scabbers streaking away.

Ron!  No!

HERMIONE

As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give
chase.

Harry and Hermione reach the top of the ridge.  Stop.

HERMIONE

Now behave yourself.

Willow.

HARRY

That's not good.

Ron!  Run!

Ron spins.  Looks toward Harry.

Harry!  Run!

RON

Harry's eyes shift.  Bounding toward him in the gathering
gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG.  Harry
shields himself when... the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM.

Aaaahhh!

RON

The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's
foot, dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll.
Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs
Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground.

I've got you --

HERMIONE

Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
three of them go scudding along.

Harry!

RON

Harry raises his chin.  The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree, begins to pull Ron through...

Hold on, Ron!

HARRY

But it's no use.  The dog is too powerful.  Harry glances
around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
in Ron's eyes.  He can read his mind.

No, Ron...

HARRY

One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's
forearm.  Sacrificing himself.

Nooooo!!!

HARRY

But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and...

Disappears.  As his VOICE ECHOES deep into the earth...

Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole.

WHOMP!  The Whomping Willow sweeps first Hermione, then
Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides.

HARRY AND HERMIONE'S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD

Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing
softly.

BACK TO SCENE

As one, they rise.  Run back toward the gap in the tree.
A branch swoops down.
Hermione ducks.  Harry doesn't.  WHOOSH -- he is flung
one way, his GLASSES the other.

Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch.  She looks down, sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses.

Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!

HERMIONE

Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head.  He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground.

Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear
life, and Harry rises.  FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked
to the ground again.  Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them.
Rising, he fits them to his face and...

HIS BLURRY POV...

... turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

HERMIONE

HARRY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Hermione reaches out, grabs Harry's shirt and -- riding
the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling
toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into
the darkness...

Hermione falls on top of him.

HERMIONE

Don't mention it.  Lumos.

HARRY

As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking
tunnel.

Where do you suppose this goes?

HERMIONE

HARRY

I have a hunch.  I just hope I'm
wrong...

111A

INT. TUNNEL TO SHRIEKING SHACK - NIGHT

111A

Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive
passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead.
Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends.  Confused, Harry and
Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up.  A
small opening.  Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.

112

INT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM - NIGHT

112

Harry pulls Hermione up.  Looks about.  Paper peels from
the walls.  Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood
-- blot the floorboards.  Shattered furniture lies strewn
everywhere.

HERMIONE

We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

Harry doesn't answer, staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST
on the floor.  The CEILING CREAKS.  They dash to the stairs.

113

INT. HALLWAY - LANDING - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)

113

They come out, look down.  A wide, shiny stripe cuts
through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been
dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps
from a door.

Nox.

RON

It's a trap, Harry.  He's the dog.
He's an Animagus...

Harry looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to
a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET.  Harry looks up slowly at
the MAN standing in the shadows.  Filthy, matted hair
hangs to his shoulders.  His skin like a corpse.

SIRIUS BLACK.

He studies Harry's face keenly.  Harry draws his wand.

HERMIONE

If you want to kill Harry, you'll
-- you'll... have to kill us, too!

No.  Only one will die tonight.

SIRIUS BLACK

HARRY
Then it'll be you!

Harry!  No!

HERMIONE

Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound.  Black wheels toward the
door, edgy.  Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
violently.  As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry
cautiously.

Going to kill me, Harry?

SIRIUS BLACK

Yes.

HARRY

Harry raises his wand.  BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN:
Lupin.

Professor Lupin!

HARRY/HERMIONE/RON

Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
Sirius?  Finally the skin reflects
the madness within.

SIRIUS BLACK

You'd know all about the madness
within, wouldn't you, Remus?

The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension,
then Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like a
brother.

HERMIONE

No!  I trusted you!  I covered up
for you.  And all this time you've
been his friend!

(pointing)

He's a werewolf!  That's why he's
been missing classes!

Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin.  Black HOWLS
then, bitterly amused.  Lupin eyes him, then turns back.

How long have you known?

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HERMIONE

Since Professor Snape set the
essay.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

You're the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met, Hermione.

SIRIUS BLACK

Yes, you glow like the sun.  And
you howl at the moon.  Enough
talk!  He dies.  Now.  If you
won't do it with me, Remus, I'll
do it alone.

Lupin eyes Black, then nods.

All right then.  As you wish...

PROFESSOR LUPIN

No!

HARRY

Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick
of his own, disarms him.  Furious, Harry eyes Black
murderously.

HARRY

You betrayed my parents!  You sold
them to Voldemort!

SIRIUS BLACK

It's a lie!  I never would've
betrayed James and Lily!

Harry!  You've got to listen --

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HARRY

Did he listen!  When my mother was
dying!  Did he hear her screaming!

SIRIUS BLACK

No!  I wasn't there!  And I'll
regret it the rest of my life!

Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Someone else betrayed your
parents, Harry.  Someone in this
room right now.  Someone who,
until quite recently, I believed
to be dead.

He's as good as dead.

SIRIUS BLACK

HARRY

There's nobody here.

Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing
song:

SIRIUS BLACK
Come out, come out, Peter
Come out, come out and play...

Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.

You're mad...

RON

Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
Scabbers TWISTS violently.  As a curious expression
befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one, raise their
wands... when.

Expelliarmus!

SNAPE

The wands fly from their hands.  The others turn, find
Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly.

SNAPE

(eying Black)

Ah, vengeance is sweet.  How I
hoped I'd be the one to catch you.

Severus --

PROFESSOR LUPIN

SNAPE

I told Dumbledore you were helping
your old friend into the castle.
And here's the proof.

SIRIUS BLACK

Brilliant!  And -- as usual --
dead wrong.  Now give us our wands
back.  Remus and I have a bit of
unfinished business to tend to.

As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.

Give me a reason.  I beg you.

Don't be a fool, Severus!

(clucking his tongue)
Listen to you two.  Quarreling
like an old married couple.  The
creature and the criminal.

SIRIUS BLACK
Piss off.
SNAPE

Witty as ever I see.  Tell me,
will you be so irreverent when I
turn you over to the Dementors?

(as Black reacts)

Do I detect a flicker of fear?
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementor's
Kiss.  It's said to be unbearable
to witness.  But I'll do my best.

Snape's eyes harden.  He gestures to the door.

After you.

SNAPE

As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harry's wand.  In a flash, it's in
his hand.

Expelliarmus!

HARRY

Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
slides down.  Ron and Hermione stare in shock.

Harry.  You attacked a teacher.

HERMIONE

Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.

You said Peter before.  Peter who?

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Pettigrew.  He was at school with
us.  We thought he was a friend.

No.  Pettigrew's dead.  He killed
him.

As Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I thought so, too.  Until you
mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the
Map.

The Map was lying then --

HARRY

SIRIUS BLACK

The Map never lies.  Pettigrew's
alive.  And he's right there.

Black points at... Ron.  Ron goes white with fear.

M-me?  It's lunatic...

RON

Not you, you idiot.  Your rat.

SIRIUS BLACK

RON

Scabbers?  Scabbers has been in my
family for --

SIRIUS BLACK

Twelve years.  A curiously long
life for a common garden rat.
He's missing a toe, isn't he?

Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily
Prophet:  it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers
on his shoulder.

So what?

Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes.  Wanting to
believe.  Desperate to believe.  Glances at Ron, his
agonized face.  Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.

Show me.

HARRY

Lupin and Black turn to Ron.  He holds Scabbers
protectively.

What are you going to do to him?

RON

Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.

Together.

SIRIUS BLACK

With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT.  Scabbers twists
madly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into... a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands.
PETER PETTIGREW.

PETTIGREW

S-Sirius... R-Remus.  My old
friends.

Neither speaks.  Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door.  Suddenly, he makes a
break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back.
Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry.  His
hands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.

PETTIGREW

Harry!  Look at you!  Y-you look
just like your father.  Like
James.  We were the best of
friends, he and I --

Shut up!

SIRIUS BLACK

PETTIGREW

I didn't mean to!  The Dark Lord,
you have no idea the weapons he
possesses!  Ask yourself what you
would have done, Sirius.  What
would you have done!

SIRIUS BLACK

Died!  Died rather than betray my

realized, Peter, if Voldemort
didn't kill you...

We would.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

No... please... you can't...

PETTIGREW

(eyes darting,
 finding)

Ron!  Haven't I been a good
friend?  A good pet?  You won't
let them kill me, will you?  I was
your rat...

Ron draws back in disgust.  Pettigrew turns to Hermione.

PETTIGREW

Sweet girl.  Clever girl.  Surely
you won't let them...

As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point them
directly into Pettigrew's face.  He shrinks back
trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...

No.

HARRY

Pettigrew's lids lift.  Lupin and Black turn.  Staggered.

Harry, this man...

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HARRY

I know what he is.  But we'll take
him to the castle.

Bless you, boy!  Bless you --

PETTIGREW

HARRY

Get off!  I said we'd take you to
the castle.  After that, the
Dementors can have you.

As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles
desperately:

PETTIGREW

Turn me into a maggot.  A dung
beetle.  A Flobberworm!  Anything
but the Dementors...

(as Ron emerges)

Ron!  Haven't I been a good
friend?  A good pet?  You won't
let them kill me, will you?  I was
your rat...

As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMPS
his head against a low limb.  Hermione turns to Harry.

HERMIONE

Don't worry.  He's under the
Somnambulist Charm.  It's
primarily used to transport the
seriously deranged.

As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.

PETTIGREW

Sweet girl.  Clever girl.  Surely
you won't let them...

Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp.
Harry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle,
shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.

SIRIUS BLACK

Beautiful, isn't it?  I'll never
forget the first time I walked
through those doors.  It'll be
nice to do it again.  Freely.

(turning to Harry)

That was a noble thing you did
back there.  He doesn't deserve
it.

Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away.  Lost in
thought.

HARRY

I don't reckon my father'd want
his best friends to become killers
for a worthless piece of vermin
like Pettigrew.  Besides:  Dead,
the truth dies with him.  Alive...
you're free.

Sirius studies Harry's profile, moved by this.

SIRIUS BLACK

I don't know if you know, Harry,
but when you were born, James and
Lily made me your guardian...

I know.

HARRY

SIRIUS BLACK

And, well, I'll understand if you
choose to stay with your aunt and
uncle, but, so you know, you
could --

Come live with you?  When!

HARRY

Soon as my name's cleared...

SIRIUS BLACK

Harry looks at Hogwarts.  GRINS.  Sirius does the same.
Then, Hermione's voice rises on the air, quavering with
fear.

Harry...

HERMIONE

He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON.  His
eyes shift.  Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers
twitching.

SIRIUS BLACK

Remus, old friend... did you take
your potion tonight?

Lupin, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD.  Pettigrew's eyes
dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note
the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST.

Run.  All of you.  Now.

SIRIUS BLACK

But none of them do, transfixed, watching as BRISTLES
POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN.  Black steps forward, wraps
his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.

SIRIUS BLACK

You know the man you truly are,
Remus.  This flesh is only flesh.

This heart is where you truly

As Lupin's WAND DROPS... Pettigrew LEAPS.

HARRY

No!

(flashing his wand)

Expelliarmus!

Lupin's wand flies from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES.
Then slowly turns.  Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
HIDEOUSLY.  Transforms.  Stunned, Harry watches a RAT
dart into the night.

A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels.  With a shrug,
Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns.  He is no
longer human.  He's a werewolf.  Harry and Hermione begin
to edge back.

Professor...?

HERMIONE

The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze.  Long teeth glitter.  Then...
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat.  Harry and
Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape.
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes
flutter open, the spell broken.  Seeing Hermione atop
him, he sweeps her aside...

Out of the way!

SNAPE

... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce.  Leaping
to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward,
shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron.

The WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR.  They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single
horrible flailing beast.  Again and again, the dog pushes
the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...

Sirius!

HARRY

The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass.  As it charges after, Harry pushes
past Snape, dashes into the night.  Hermione makes to
follow, but Snape holds her back.

Harry!

HERMIONE

Harry runs full out.  Up ahead, FRAMED AGAINST A FULL
MOON, he spies the dog, lying inert, the werewolf's
razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck.

NO!!!

HARRY

Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might.  Bull's-eye.  The
werewolf freezes.  Turns.  Begins to move toward...
Harry.

Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well,
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast.

HARRY

Please, Professor.  Stop... It's
me.

Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.

The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest.
Harry waits, petrified.  The WEREWOLF's eyes shift back
to him.  It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill.  Harry
covers his face with his arm, when...

... a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest.  Slowly,
Harry drops his arm.  Looks.  The werewolf bounds toward
the forest, vanishes.  Harry's eyes shift.  In the
darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass.
Falls.  Rises.  Falls again.  Each time becoming more
human.  As he disappears over the ridge, Harry sprints
after.

117A

EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Harry stumbles down to Black, who lies on the water's
edge, now fully a man, arms and face gleaming with
lacerations.

Sirius!

117A

A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth.  A raw WIND TOSSES
his hair.  CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN.  A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lake's edge.  Then they appear, oozing
like smoke through the TREES across the lake.  Dementors.

HARRY

No... No!

(drawing his wand)

Expecto... Patronum!

A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering
like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come.  Harry
places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand
once more:

Expecto... Patronum...

HARRY

Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies.  Harry's
eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision,
drawing closer.  Black GASPS.  SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving
him...

Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees.  Harry squints, sees
a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing
through the trees... sowing light in the darkness.  The
Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them,
sweeping down in waves.  Still, the stag charges on.  The
LIGHT EXPANDS.  The forest blazing with it.  The remaining
Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.

The light ebbs.  The stag's luminous body flickers.
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the
size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in
the trees.  Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone.

Silence drops like a curtain.  MIST rises from the lake.
As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we --

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... out of HERMIONE'S SHADOW,

Hermione paces.  Stops.

HERMIONE

HARRY

HERMIONE

HARRY

He sent the Dementors away... I
saw him.  Across the lake...

Hermione exchanges a private glance with Ron, turns back.

HERMIONE

Listen, Harry.  They've captured
Sirius.  Any minute the Dementors
are going to perform the Kiss.

The Kiss...?

HARRY

HERMIONE

It's what Dementors do to those
they want to destroy.  They clamp
their jaws over the victim's mouth
and... suck out his soul.

HARRY

You mean, they're going to kill
Sirius?

HERMIONE

No.  It's worse.  Much worse.  You
go on living.  But you have no
memory.  No sense of self.  You're
just a shall.  An empty shell...

As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.

HERMIONE

Headmaster!  You've got to stop
them!  They've got the wrong man!

HARRY

It's true, sir.  Sirius is
innocent --

It's Scabbers who did it!

My rat, sir.  Only he's not really
a rat.  Well, he was a rat.  You
see, he used to be my brother
Percy's --

HERMIONE

The point is... we know the truth.
Please, sir, you must believe us.

DUMBLEDORE

I do, Miss Granger.  But I'm sorry
to say the word of three thirteen-
year-old wizards will convince few
others.  A child's voice, however
honest and true, is meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen.

As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky.

DUMBLEDORE

Ah... a shooting star.  If ever
one was to make a wish, now would
be the time.  But time, I'm
afraid, is precisely our
problem...

On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!...
DING!

DUMBLEDORE

Mysterious thing, time.  Powerful.
And, when meddled with...
dangerous.  Sirius Black is in the
topmost cell of the Dark Tower.

(to Hermione)

You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.  And you
would, I feel, do well to return
before this last chime.  If not...
well, the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss.  Three
turns should do it, I think.  If
you succeed, more than one
innocent life may be spared
tonight.

Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of
CHOCOLATE, then starts to go... stops.

DUMBLEDORE

By the way, when in doubt, I find
retracing my steps to be a wise
place to begin... Good luck.

He smiles, exits.  Harry glances curiously at the
chocolate.

RON

What in bloody hell was all that
about?

But Hermione doesn’t reply, instead looping the pendant's
long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.

HERMIONE

Sorry, Ron.  But seeing as you
can't walk...

As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL
continues to CHIME -- DING!  DING! -- and...

INT. HOSPITAL WING - TIME REVERSAL - NIGHT/LATE
AFTERNOON

TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape
were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the
hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while,
outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the
sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon.
At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is...

Empty.  Except for Harry and Hermione.  As Hermione
unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.

What just happened?  Where's Ron?

HARRY

Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the
wall.

Seven-thirty.  Where were we at
seven-thirty?

Huh?  Dunno... going to Hagrid's?

to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths.

HARRY

But that... that's... us.  This is
not... normal.

INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN.

Dumbfounded, Harry turns.  Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.

HERMIONE

This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first
term.  This is how I've been
getting to my lessons all year.

You mean, we've gone back in time?

HARRY

HERMIONE

Yes.  Dumbledore wanted us to
return to this moment.  Clearly
something happened he wants us to
change.

A soft SMACK is HEARD.  They turn, see Malfoy land on

kisser.

HARRY

Good punch.

Hurry!  Malfoy's coming!

HERMIONE

Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge.  Seconds later,
FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.

DRACO (O.S.)

Not a word of this to anyone,
understood!  I'll get that jumped-
up Mudblood one of these days.
Mark my words...

Eyes narrowed in anger, Hermione leans out, reaches up,
and sends Malfoy SPRAWLING.  As Harry pulls her back,
Malfoy looks around in confusion, then dashes off with
the others.

Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight
of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the
slope to Hagrid's hut.  His eyes shift to the pumpkin
patch.

Look.  Buckbeak's still alive.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Of course!  Remember what
Dumbledore said.  If we succeed,
more than one innocent life could
be spared.

Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others
approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.

Here they come.  I better hurry.

HARRY

HERMIONE

No!  Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.  Otherwise,
he'll think Hagrid set him free!

Harry nods, then looks toward the hut.  Inside, Hagrid is
handing Scabbers to Ron.

HARRY
That's Pettigrew --

As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks
fiercely.

HERMIONE
No, Harry!  You can't!

HARRY

Hermione, that's the man who
betrayed my parents!  You don't
expect me to just sit here...

HERMIONE

Yes!  You Must!

(pointing inside)

Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
right now.  If you go bursting
inside, you'll think you've gone
mad.  Awful things can happen when
wizards meddle with time.  We

Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing
closer.  She frowns, glances into the hut.

Fudge is coming and... we're not

Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices
a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE.  Instantly, she grabs it,
rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW.  SMASH!  The
sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.

Are you mad?

HARRY

Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone
through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of
Harry's head.

That hurt.

Sorry.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Crows begin to drop atop the roof.  Fudge's party
arrives, RAPS on the door.

HERMIONE

C'mon.  Any minute now we're going
to be coming out the back door.

Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly
behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding.  As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,
Hermione ponders the back of her own head.

HERMIONE

Is that really what my hair looks
like from the back?

Shhh!

HARRY

Hermione sees herself turn.  Ducking, she accidentally
stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY.  Next
she hears her own voice:

Never mind.

Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope.
The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.

Now, Harry!

HERMIONE

As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
his ankles, pecking at his feet.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)

'It is the decision of the
Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures that the
Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter
called the condemned, shall be
executed this day at sundown...'

As Harry approaches, Buckbeak studies him curiously, a
ferret leg dangling from his beak.  Harry bows.  SLURP!
The ferret leg disappears and Buckbeak returns Harry's
nod.  As Harry takes Buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed
crow PECKS his hand.

Get away!

HARRY

Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's
chain.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)

'The Committee's appointed
executioner shall dispatch the
condemned by means of
beheading...'

C'mon, Buckbeak.  Come on...

HARRY

Buckbeak refuses to move.

CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)

'As witnessed below.'  You sign
here, Hagrid.  Very well,
gentlemen.  Let's step outside,
shall we...

DING!  The Hogwarts BELL begins to TOLL.  Harry and

nice dead ferret... yum yum...

Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working.
As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter.

DING!

Harry and Hermione lead Buckbeak away when the back door
suddenly opens.  They freeze... caught... Fudge's eyes
drifting their way, when -- as before -- Dumbledore
raises his hand and directs the attention of the others
away from Buckbeak.

DUMBLEDORE

Professor Dippet had those
blackberries planted when he was
Headmaster...

Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into
the forest... just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

Let's get this over with, shall
we?

Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW
STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner
approach the pumpkin patch... and stop.  Quickly, the
confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.

CORNELIUS FUDGE

But... where is it?  I just saw
the beast not moments ago --
Hagrid?

Beaky...

HAGRID

Hearing Hagrid's husky voice, BUCKBEAK strains at his
tether, WHIMPERS eerily.  Hermione tosses him another
ferret.

I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
suggesting that you had anything
to do with it, Hagrid.  How could
you?  You've been with us all
along.

We should search the grounds --

CORNELIUS FUDGE

DUMBLEDORE

Search the skies if you must,
Minister.  In the meantime, I
wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
Hagrid.  Or... a large brandy.

It seems your services will no
longer be required.

The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury

SICKENING CHOP!

A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass.  Harry
watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before.  The
werewolf turns, begins to stalk...

OWWWWWWWWW!  Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to
her mouth, making a loud HOWL.  He covers her mouth.

HARRY
What are you doing?

Saving your life.

HERMIONE

Harry looks back to the tall grass.  The werewolf is
frozen.  As before, it begins to approach Harry again.

OWWWWWWWW!  This time, Harry doesn't stop her.

Thanks.  But we have to move.

HARRY

Why?

HERMIONE

HARRY

Because that werewolf you just
called is running right this way.

They exchange a glance and... RUN.

Harry and Hermione dash for the lives, swing behind a
HUGE TREE.  As CAMERA BEGINS TO CIRCLE, the werewolf
appears.  Pauses.  As it approaches the tree, Harry and
Hermione silently sidestep in the opposite direction,
until the werewolf... disappears.  CAMERA CONTINUES TO
CIRCLE the tree...

Buckbeak.  We've got to find him.

HERMIONE

... and REVEALS the werewolf, fifteen feet past, waiting.
As Harry and Hermione step out, they freeze.  The
werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when...

SKREEEK!  The TREES shake with the fury of a HURRICANE
and Buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening Harry
and Hermione.  The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
charge.  With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws
slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face.
The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then...
HOWLS.  Turning, it vanishes into the forest.

HERMIONE

Poor Professor Lupin is having a
really tough night...

Just then, a CHILL WIND rises...

The LEAVES of the trees TREMBLE...

EERIE SHADOWS flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke...

Dementors.

Let's go.

HARRY

CUT TO:

MOVING POV

Looking UPWARD... THROUGH the trees as the sky wheels by,
Dementors streaking IN AND OUT OF VIEW.

EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT BLACK LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS

CAMERA RUSHES IN, HOLDS ON Harry and Hermione's faces.

Shocked.

Terror-stricken.

Opposite them, across the lake...

130C

EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME

130C

... a CYCLONE of DEMENTORS whirl madly above Harry and
Black.

INTERCUT BETWEEN BLACK LAKE AND EDGE OF FOREST.

Harry watches himself vainly attempt to conjure a
Patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow...

This is horrible...

HERMIONE

HARRY

Don't worry.  My Dad will come...
Right there... you'll see... he'll
come... any minute... he'll
conjure the Patronus

Hermione eyes Harry warily.  He is transfixed, staring
hungrily toward the outcrop.  The WIND RISES.  The Lake
begins to freeze.  WHOOSH!  WHOOSH!  One after another,
Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...

No one's coming, Harry...

HERMIONE

HE WILL!  He will come!

HARRY

She looks.  Nothing.  Desperately, her eyes flash to the
cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the
water's edge... wracked with pain... dying...

HERMIONE

No one's coming!  You're dying,
both of you... and no one's
coming!

Harry's face changes.  A riddle unravels.  He draws his
wand.

HARRY, NO!

HERMIONE

(CONTINUED)

130C

CONTINUED:

130C

Too late.  Harry slashes through the trees, down to the
rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father
appeared.  Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of
Dementors on the other side of the lake.

EXPECTO PATRONUM!

HARRY

A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST,
then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY.  The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT.
The Lake BLAZES with reflected FIRE.  Harry stands
utterly still, wand extended to the heavens.  Across the
lake, the Dementors retreat.  Harry waits, still as a
statue, until each and every one is gone.

Then he simply lets his arm drop.

131

EXT. HOGWARTS - SKY - FLYING - NIGHT (LATER)

131

WHOOSH!  Harry and Hermione plunge INTO FRAME astride
Buckbeak, SOARING toward the castle.  Outside the
grounds, the Dementors wait restlessly.  Up ahead, Fudge
and Snape enter the Dark Tower, TORCHES in hand.

HARRY

You were right, Hermione.  It
wasn't my dad I saw earlier.  It
was... me.  I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.  I knew I
could do it this time, because...
because I'd already done it.  Does
that make sense?

Hermione contemplates this.

HERMIONE

No.

(looking down
 in fear)

But I don't like this!

EXT. HOGWARTS - DARK TOWER - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT (MOMENTS

We see Buckbeak land.

Sirius paces within a SMALL CELL, a man condemned.
Spying Harry and Hermione, he stops.  Stunned to see
them.

Snape, TORCH in hand, leads the way as Fudge HUFFS after.

EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Hermione pushes past Harry.

HERMIONE

Out of the way!

Alohomora!

(raising her wand)

Sirius tests the IRON DOOR.  Still locked.

Didn't really expect that to work.

HERMIONE

136

EXT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Snape and Fudge draw closer...

137

EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

Wand flashing, Hermione tries spell after spell.

HERMIONE

Dunamis!  Liberare!  Annihilare!
Emancipare!

No.  No.  No.  No.

You might try --

SIRIUS BLACK

Quiet!  I'm trying to think.

HERMIONE

134

135

136

137

She resumes pacing, MUTTERING furiously.  Then... stops.
Turns.

BOMBARDA!

HERMIONE

KA-BOOM!  The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky.

That'll do.

SIRIUS BLACK

138

EXT. SKY/HOGWARTS - HELICOPTER SHOT - NIGHT

138

We see Buckbeak spirit Harry, Hermione and Sirius off the
terrace and soar directly TOWARD us... Just as Snape and
Fudge reach the top of the Tower.

Sirius laughs, hair blowing in the wind.

SIRIUS BLACK

You truly are your father's son,
Harry!

140

EXT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

140

Black puts his hands to Hermione's waist, swings her off
Buckbeak and onto the ground next to Harry.

SIRIUS BLACK

I'll be forever grateful for this.
To both of you.

I want to go with you.

HARRY

SIRIUS BLACK

One day perhaps.  For some time...
life will be too... unpredictable.
Besides, you're meant to be here.

Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye.

But promise me something, Harry.

SIRIUS BLACK

Anything.

HARRY

SIRIUS BLACK

Trust yourself.  No matter the
challenges you face -- and I fear
they will be many -- you'll be
surprised how many times you can
find the answers...

(tapping his heart)

...here.

As Sirius climbs atop Buckbeak, a SHOOTING STAR arcs
through the heavens.

A shooting star.  Make a wish.

SIRIUS BLACK

WHACK! -- Black gives Buckbeak a SLAP and they soar into
the glittering sky.  Harry and Hermione stand watching,
when... DING!  They wheel.  Look to the Clock Tower.

We have to go.

HERMIONE

... the corridor.  The Clock Tower BELL THUNDERS.  The
DOOR OPENS.  Dumbledore backs out...

DUMBLEDORE

By the way, when in doubt, I
always find retracing my steps to
be a wise place to begin... Good
luck.

As Dumbledore begins to close the door, Harry and
Hermione stumble frantically forward, the door about to
hit the jamb, when... suddenly... Dumbledore stops.
Looks up.

Well?

DUMBLEDORE

HARRY

He's free -- Sirius.  We... we did
it.

Did what?

DUMBLEDORE

With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the
door.  As Harry and Hermione enter.

INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

145

... they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves...
across the room... just as they EVAPORATE.  Ron blinks.
Turns.  Frowns.

RON

How'd you two get over there?  I
was just talking to you... over
there.

(CONTINUED)

Ron glances to the other side of the room.  Frowns.
Hermione glances mischievously to Harry.

HERMIONE

What d'you think, Harry?  Too much
for him -- everything that's
happened tonight?

HARRY

Afraid so.  Always been a bit of
the nervous type, Ron has.

Ron stares at them, confounded.  Slowly, they... GRIN.

146

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING

The Whomping Willow sways in a light breeze.  The Black
Lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.

147

INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN'S OFFICE - MORNING

Harry walks softly toward an OPEN DOOR -- Lupin's
office -- and peers in.  Lupin stands over a battered
suitcase, filling it with the last of his books.  Without
turning, he SPEAKS.

146

147

Hello, Harry.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry JUMPS.  Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.

Saw you coming.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk.
Harry nods, looks back to Lupin.  Unable to disguise his
shock at Lupin's appearance.

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I've looked worse, believe me.

Harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare
bookshelves...

HARRY
You've been sacked.

Resigned, actually.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

(CONTINUED)

147

CONTINUED:

125.

147

HARRY
Resigned!  But why!

PROFESSOR LUPIN

It seems that someone has let slip
the nature of my condition.

Snape.

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Whoever.  It was bound to get out.
This time tomorrow, the owls will
start arriving.  Parents will not
want a -- someone like me --
teaching their children.

But Dumbledore --

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Has already risked enough on my
behalf.  Besides, people like me,
well... let's just say I'm used to
this by now.  But before I go,
tell me about your Patrons.

HARRY

Well.  At first I thought it was a
horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I
think it was --

A stag.

Yes.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

HARRY

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Your father used to transform into
one.  That's how he was able to
keep me company when I became...
sick.  He was a great friend
James.

Lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase.  Then
stops.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

There are stories about him and your mother, you know.
Some are even true.  But I think it's safe to say, in the
end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself.
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand.

(CONTINUED)

147

CONTINUED:  (2)

Mischief managed.

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry watches the Map go blank.  Looks back.  Lupin is
gone.

INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Ron stands amid a circle of excited Gryffindors.

RON

Stand back, I said!  I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle!

As Harry arrives, he glances at Hermione, who CLEARS HER
THROAT LOUDLY.  The others turn, begin all speaking at
once.

148

149

Harry!  Wherever did you get it!

NEVILLE

SEAMUS

Can I have a go, Harry?  After
you, of course --

RON

Quiet!

(as they oblige)

Thank you.  Let the man through.

Mystified, Harry steps forward, the boys peeling away,
clearing his view of the BROOMSTICK in Ron's hands.  The
LABEL GLEAMS:  "FIREBOLT."

Whose is that?

HARRY

RON

(as everyone laughs)

Whose is it?  It's yours, mate.

But... how?  Who?

HARRY

HERMIONE

It's a mystery.  Though... this
fell out of the wrapping.

Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.

(CONTINUED)

That's a Hippogriff feather --

As Harry stops short, Hermione raises her eyebrow.  As
they share a secret glance, we...

CUT TO:

INT./EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT DOORS - DAY

150

BOOM!  The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry,
trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt.  As he
strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about.

151

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

151

As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.

Go on, Harry.

SEAMUS

Yeah.  Let's see.

NEVILLE

Harry mounts the broom.  Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air.  A few others do the same.  Hagrid does the
same.  Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down.  Finally, Harry places his hand
on the broom.  Sets his grip.  Takes a breath.  And...

Frowns.

What's wrong?

FRED/GEORGE

HARRY

I don't think it works.  I think
it's defective.

A collective GROAN.  Dejected, many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle.  Harry calls after.

HARRY

Oh, come on now.  It's just a
broom.

HAGRID

(nodding sagely)

Just a broom.

(CONTINUED)

151

Harry's eye shifts to Ron and Hermione.  A wink.

The fastest broom in the world.

HARRY

As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we --

CUT TO:

152

EXT. HIGH IN THE SKY - DAY (SAME TIME)

152

A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward.
It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the
Firebolt.  A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches.  A
scream of release, of utter abandon.  It's Harry
screaming.  But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and...

The SCREEN GOES BLACK.

It's a SCREAM of joy.

FADE OUT.
