DARKNESS.

THUNDER -- or something like it -- sounds in the 
distance.

BOOM.  Then again.  BOOM.

We GLIDE THROUGH the inky blackness.  Ambient flashes 
illuminate the silhouette of the WB LOGO.  We PASS 
THROUGH.

INTO more darkness.  Lost.  More FLASHES.  And we --

CUT TO:

A SINGLE EYE

Blank behind glasses.  FLASH!  The PUPIL CONTRACTS and  
we --

CUT TO:

1

INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - ATRIUM - WIDER ANGLE - DAY

1

To find... HARRY POTTER, standing numbly beside ALBUS 
DUMBLEDORE amidst a MOB of REPORTERS.  CAMERAS FLASH.  
Dumbledore’s hand finds his shoulder and Harry is moving, 
drifting through the chaos, Dumbledore protective, 
graceful, dignified.

CLOSEUP - HARRY’S GLASSES

His eyes dart from side to side.  The lenses glimmer with 
abstraction.  We --

DISSOLVE INTO:

EXT. LONDON OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

... glass, a window, its surface prickling with another 
kind of ambient light.  We are looking INTO a conference 
room where office workers sit around a table.  But the 
light has caught one worker’s eye, then another, and soon 
they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized 
by what lies beyond.

WORKERS’ POV - LONDON SKYLINE

Blood-red and stormy.  A VORTEX of CLOUDS -- strangely 
ominous -- hangs high in the sky, flashing from within, 
as if about to rain blood over the city.  We --

CUT INTO:

THE STORM

itself and...

... PLUMMET, London expanding, stretching out on all 
sides.  We SWEEP madly OVER Charing Cross, leaving the 
Muggle world behind and SWOOP INTO...

EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY

3

... Diagon Alley just as the front window of OLLIVANDER’S 
WAND SHOP EXPLODES.  Witches and wizards flee.  In the 
drifting smoke, DEATH EATERS appear, accompanied by a 
tall, sinewy beast of a man, FENRIR GREYBACK.  With a 
casual sweep of his hand he sends a wizard flying and a 
witch screams.  In deep b.g., two Death Eaters abduct a 
SHROUDED FIGURE (Ollivander).  Greyback grins, then 
APPARATES, along with the others...

... leaving Diagon Alley behind.  The streets of London 
appear below once more, and then the river.  Black trails 
-- the Death Eaters -- streak across the sky and then 
turn TRANSLUCENT as they encircle the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE.  
Pedestrians peer upward, bewildered, sensing a shift in 
the atmosphere.  And then...

The BRIDGE CRUMBLES into the THAMES, the image 
horrifyingly beautiful, as is the SOUND of it, a ROAR, a 
wail, the last cry of a lion.  Then the image begins to 
FADE and all goes slowly SILENT, until only a WHISTLING 
WIND is heard and...

EXT. MILL TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

... tall grasses toss dreamily in a SLANTING RAIN.  An 
OLD MILL lists like an ancient ruin against a charcoal 
sky.  A DARK FIGURE (NARCISSA MALFOY) MATERIALIZES.  As 
she turns for the town in the distance, another witch 
materializes:  BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.

Narcissa!

BELLATRIX

EXT. SPINNER’S END - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

Like a rat in a maze, Narcissa makes her way through a 
labyrinth of dilapidated brick houses.  Bellatrix trails.

BELLATRIX

Cissy! You mustn’t do this.  He 
can’t be trusted.

The Dark Lord trusts him.

NARCISSA

The Dark Lord is mistaken.

BELLATRIX

Narcissa turns, shocked.  Bellatrix looks shocked 
herself, rain running down her cheeks.

Or so I believe.

BELLATRIX

NARCISSA

Well, who can one trust these 
days?

INT. MILL HOUSE - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON

Grim and dark, lit by guttering candles.  RAIN drums the 
roof eerily.  A KNOCKER CLANGS.  A SQUAT MAN SHUFFLES 
forth, something familiar in his gait.

EXT. HOUSE (SPINNER’S END) - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON

The door cracks, spilling sallow light onto Narcissa and 
Bellatrix.  A face:  WORMTAIL.

INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

The sisters follow Wormtail down a narrow hallway.

He lives in this Muggle dunghill?

BELLATRIX

Wormtail glowers over his shoulder at her.  They pass 
into...

On the front page is a PHOTOGRAPH of the MILLENNIUM 
BRIDGE CRASHING INTO THE THAMES.  But even more prominent 
is the SILHOUETTE of a YOUNG WIZARD and a HEADLINE:

HARRY POTTER:  THE CHOSEN ONE?

Young Wizard Destined to Kill You-Know-Who?

The paper drops and SEVERUS SNAPE eyes the women 
curiously.

SNAPE
Run along, Wormtail.

INT. MILL HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 
LATER)

10

Snape fills the last of three goblets with wine.

NARCISSA

I’ve nowhere else to turn, 
Severus.

Snape hands her a goblet, extends one to Bellatrix.

You must be joking.

BELLATRIX

Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his own lips.

NARCISSA

I know I ought not to be here.  
The Dark Lord himself has 
forbidden me to speak of this --

SNAPE

If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, 
you ought not to speak.

(eyes shifting)

Put it down, Bella.  We mustn’t 
touch what isn’t ours.

Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it back 
down.

SNAPE

As it so happens I’m aware of your 
situation, Narcissa.

You? The Dark Lord told you?

BELLATRIX

Your sister doubts me, Narcissa.  
Understandable.  

SNAPE

SNAPE (CONT'D)

Over the years I have played my 
part well.  So well I’ve deceived 
one of the greatest wizards of all 
time.

Bellatrix makes a scathing sound.  Snape turns, eyes 
hard.

SNAPE

Dumbledore is a great wizard.  
Only a fool would question it.

I... I don’t doubt you, Severus.

NARCISSA

BELLATRIX

You should feel honored, Cissy.  
As should Draco --

He’s just a boy!

NARCISSA

SNAPE

I can’t change the Dark Lord’s 
mind.  But it might be possible 
for me to help Draco.  To provide 
some... protection.

Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly.

Do you mean it, Severus?

NARCISSA

I can try.

SNAPE

NARCISSA

Oh, Severus, please, if you   
would... (I would be forever in 
your debt.)

Swear to it.

BELLATRIX

Snape’s eyes shift, meet Bellatrix’s challenging gaze.

*
*

BELLATRIX

Make the Unbreakable Vow.

(as Snape looks away)

You see.  It’s just empty words.  
Oh he’ll try.  He’ll give it his 
best effort.  But when it matters 
most he’ll slither back into his 
hole.  Bloody coward...

Bellatrix goes on MUTTERING as she splashes some wine 
into a goblet.  Snape turns back, anger flashing in his 
eyes.

10

SNAPE
Take out your wand.

Bellatrix freezes, goblet to her lips.  As she lowers it, 
a rivulet of red runs out of the corner of her mouth.

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Snape faces Narcissa.  Bellatrix, hand faintly trembling, 
places the tip of her wand over their LINKED hands.

BELLATRIX

Will you, Severus Snape, watch 
over Draco Malfoy as he attempts 
to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes.

I will.

SNAPE

A SINGLE STRAND of LIQUID FIRE issues from Bellatrix’s 
wand and wends its way around their hands.

BELLATRIX

And will you, to the best of your 
ability, protect him from harm?

I will.

SNAPE

A SECOND STRAND of FIRE intertwines with the first.

BELLATRIX

And should it prove necessary, if 
it seems Draco will fail... will 
you yourself carry out the deed 
that the Dark Lord has ordered 
Draco to perform?

Snape’s hand TWITCHES within Narcissa’s.  Bellatrix 
waits.

I will.

SNAPE

EXT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

A TRAIN blasts through the station.

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       7.

12

EXT. “TREATS” FOOD STAND - SAME TIME - NIGHT

12

Late.  Lonely men and women loiter on the platform.  At a 
food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.  
CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror --
LANDS ON... the Daily Prophet.  The SILHOUETTE.  The 
HEADLINE:  “HARRY POTTER:  THE CHOSEN ONE?”

But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM, 
tucked at the bottom corner of the back page:  “Malfoy 
Sentenced to Azkaban.”  TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the 
piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa and 
DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom.  Draco’s eyes look 
distant, haunted.

Harry Potter.  Who’s Harry Potter?

WAITRESS (O.S.)

The paper drops, reveals... Harry.  He glances up at the 
YOUNG WAITRESS who stands over him.  Pretty.  Very 
pretty.

HARRY

Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a 
tosser.

As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harry’s 
gaze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spray 
of freckles across one cheek...

WAITRESS

Funny that paper of yours.  Couple 
nights ago, I could swear I saw 
one of the pictures move.

Really.

HARRY

Thought I’d gone round the twist.

WAITRESS

She makes a face, smiles.  A smile to die for.  Starts to 
go.

Hey.  I was wondering...

HARRY

WAITRESS

Eleven.  That’s when I get off.

(the smile)

You can tell me all about that 
tosser Harry Potter.

Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coat 
and fumbles out a S’Mints container.  Just then...

(CONTINUED)

12

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       8.
CONTINUED:
... a LIGHT on the opposite PLATFORM FLICKERS.  Harry 
looks.  It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of 
GLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform.  As a 
TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering 
windows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS 
DUMBLEDORE.  Leveling his glasses, he peers across the 
platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.

12

13

EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

13

As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME 
ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her 
teeth:  “Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.”

DUMBLEDORE

I once knew a Muggle girl from 
Liverpool with hair like spun 
silk.  No light could resist it...

(turning)

You’ve been reckless this summer, 
Harry.

HARRY

I like riding round on the trains.  
It takes my mind off... things.

Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore’s hand is ASH BLACK.

DUMBLEDORE

Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t 
it?  The tale is thrilling if I do 
say so myself, but I’m afraid now 
is not the time to tell it.  Take 
my arm.

(extending it)

Do as I say.

Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled 
Waitress appear, eye his empty table.  Slowly, he reaches 
out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND 
and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a 
tornado.  Seconds later...

14

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

14

... he re-emerges into the world, reeling, eyes stinging 
with tears.  Slowly, his planet stops spinning.

I just Apparated, didn’t I?

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Indeed.  And quite successfully I 
might add.  Most people vomit 
their first time.

HARRY
Can’t imagine why...

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Dumbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street lined 
with darkened houses.

DUMBLEDORE

Welcome to the charming village of 
Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I 
assume right about now you’re 
wondering why I’ve brought you 
here, am I right?

HARRY

(glancing about)

After all these years, I just sort 
of roll with it, sir.

Dumbledore smiles mildly, then pauses, his face 
darkening.  Before them stands a SMALL STONE HOUSE.  But 
something is wrong about the place.

Wand out, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE

15

INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT

15

THROUGH a crack in the front door:  Dumbledore and Harry 
move swiftly up the walk and enter.

Lumos...

DUMBLEDORE

The tip of Dumbledore’s WAND BLAZES.  He sweeps the 
shadows.  CALLS OUT.

Horace!

DUMBLEDORE

Nothing.  Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW 
HALLWAY.  Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but 
nothing else.  He starts down the hallway, toward the 
OPEN DOORWAY at its end.  Slowly, the room beyond comes 
INTO VIEW:

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       10.

16

INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

16

Utter devastation.  A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the 
floor, its face cracked.  A PIANO sags in the corner, 
keys strewn like teeth upon the rug.  A copy of the Daily 
Prophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.  
As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word 
“CHOSEN.”  His gaze rises.

He GASPS.  A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered 
upon the ceiling.  Dumbledore raises his wand.  The 
ceiling SCREAMS RED.  Another drop falls and this one 
strikes Harry’s SCAR.  As Harry moves to wipe it away, 
Dumbledore grabs his hand.

Training his light on Harry’s forehead, Dumbledore flicks 
a blackened finger over the scar.  Brings it to his 
tongue.  Reacts.  Turning, his eyes narrow on an 
OVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR.  Moving to it, he JABS his wand 
into the plump seat cushion.

Merlin’s Beard!

ARMCHAIR

Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though 
briefly gets caught inbetween.  After a bit of GRUMBLING, 
SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or 
two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL-
WORN lilac pajamas appears.

SLUGHORN

(rubbing his rump)

There’s no need to disfigure me, 
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE

I must say, you make a very 
convincing armchair, Horace.

SLUGHORN

It’s all in the upholstery.
(patting his stomach)

I come by the stuffing naturally.  
What gave me away?

DUMBLEDORE

(nodding to the 
ceiling)
Dragon’s blood.

SLUGHORN

Yes, well, I couldn’t very well 
use wizard’s blood, could I?  Oho!

(CONTINUED)

16

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       11.

CONTINUED:
Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry.  The 
blood on Harry’s forehead only serves to highlight his 
scar.

16

DUMBLEDORE

Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, 
this is an old friend and 
colleague of mine, Horace 
Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, 
you know who this is.

(a droll whisper)

Apparently there’s some thought he 
may be the Chosen One.

Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.

DUMBLEDORE

So why all the theatrics, Horace?  
You weren’t perhaps expecting 
someone else, were you?

SLUGHORN

(blinking)

S-someone else?  I’m sure I don’t 
know what you mean.

Dumbledore raises an eyebrow.  Slughorn caves.

SLUGHORN

Oh all right!  The Death Eaters 
have been trying to recruit me for 
over a year.  Do you know what 
that’s like?  One can only say no 
to these people so many times 
before they...

Take matters into their own hands?

DUMBLEDORE

Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.

SLUGHORN

I never stay anywhere more than a 
week.  The Muggles who own this 
place are in the Canary Islands.

DUMBLEDORE

Well, I think it should be put 
back in order for them, don’t you?  
Mind?

(CONTINUED)

16

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       12.

CONTINUED: (2)
Dumbledore raises his wand.  Instantly, the grandfather 
clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns re-
ignite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just as 
the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant 
MUSICAL run.

16

That was fun.  May I use the loo?

DUMBLEDORE

As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.

SLUGHORN

Don’t think I don’t know why 
you’re here, Albus!  The answer is 
still no!  Absolutely, 
unequivocally no!

Dumbledore doesn’t respond.  Slughorn glances at Harry.  
The silence is palpable.  Awkward.  A beat.  Then:

SLUGHORN

You look very like your father.  
Except for your eyes.  You’ve 
got -- 

My mother’s eyes, yeah.

HARRY

SLUGHORN
(smiling softly)

Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was 
exceedingly bright -- your mother.  
Even more impressive when one 
considers she was Muggle-born.

HARRY

One of my best friends is Muggle-
born.  She’s the best in our year.

SLUGHORN

Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m 
prejudiced!  No, no, no! Your 
mother was one of my absolute 
favorites!  Look, there she is.  
Right up front.

Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS.

SLUGHORN

All mine, each and every one.  Ex-
students, I mean.  You recognize 
Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor 
of the Daily Prophet.

SLUGHORN (CONT'D)

Always takes my owl should I want 
to register my opinion on the news 
of the day.  And there’s Ambrosius 
Flume of Honeydukes.  Sends a 
hamper of chocolate to the house 
each birthday.  That is, when I 
had a house.  And Gwenog Jones, 
captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- 
free tickets whenever I want them.  
Of course, I haven’t been to a 
match in some time...

16

Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particular 
BOY, a boy who resembles... Sirius.  Seeing Harry thus 
distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.

SLUGHORN

Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no 
doubt know of his older brother 
Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I 
taught the whole Black family 
except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented 
boy.  I got Regulus when he came 
along, of course, but I’d have 
liked the set.

DUMBLEDORE

Mind if I take this?  I do love 
knitting patterns.

Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds 
Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.

SLUGHORN

Of course.  But you’re not 
leaving?

DUMBLEDORE

I think I know a lost cause when I 
see one.  Regrettable.  I would 
have considered it a personal 
triumph had you consented to 
return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You 
are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- 
one of a kind.

Dumbledore HUMS placidly as he and Harry make their way 
down the walk.  Seconds later, the front door swings 
open.

SLUGHORN

All right!  I’ll do it.  But I’ll

And I expect a raise!  These are 
mad times we live in!  Mad!

Indeed they are.

EXT. STREET (BUDLEIGH BABBERTON) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Dumbledore leads Harry back toward the Village Square.

Sir, exactly what was that all -- 

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

You are talented, famous and 
powerful -- everything Horace 
values.  Professor Slughorn is 
going to try to collect you, 
Harry.  You would be his crowning 
jewel.  That is why he is 
returning to Hogwarts.  And it is 
crucial he return...

Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before 
he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the 
moon.

DUMBLEDORE

I fear I may have stolen a 
wondrous night from you, Harry.  
She was, truthfully, very pretty.  
The girl.

HARRY

It’s alright, sir.  I’ll go back 
tomorrow, make some excuse -- 

Harry stops.  Dumbledore is shaking his head.

DUMBLEDORE

You’ll not be going back to Little 
Whinging tonight, Harry.

HARRY

But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And 
there’s my trunk --

out.  As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledore’s 
cloak, he...

19

EXT. THE BURROW - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)

19

... APPARATES INTO VIEW, stumbling to one knee and 
wincing.

Sir?

HARRY

Dumbledore is gone.  Harry rises, glances about.  In the 
distance a CROOKED HOUSE shimmers.  A PRETTY GIRL with 
RED HAIR flits briefly past an upstairs window.  GINNY 
WEASLEY.

INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME - NIGHT

GINNY’S POV, looking up -- a dizzying perspective of 
twisting railings and crooked bedroom doors.  A CLOCK 
hangs IN VIEW, bearing NINE HANDS, each inscribed with a 
Weasley name, each pointing to MORTAL PERIL.  MRS. 
WEASLEY appears, looks down.

MRS. WEASLEY 

What is it, Ginny?  Is it your 
father?  Has something happened at 
the Ministry?  Has he been 
kidnapped?  Is it the Death 
Eaters?

Exactly.  How’d you guess?

I’m joking, Mum.

GINNY

You’re worse than Fred and George.

MRS. WEASLEY

GINNY

Now you’re joking.  I was only 
wondering when Harry got here.

Harry who?

MRS. WEASLEY

GINNY

Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of 
course.

MRS. WEASLEY

I think I’d know if Harry Potter 
was in my house, wouldn’t I?

GINNY

Well his trunk’s in the kitchen.  
And his owl.

I seriously doubt that.

MRS. WEASLEY

Just then, HEDWIG SCREECHES O.S.  Ginny gives her an I-
told-you-so when another door opens and RON WEASLEY looks 
down.

Harry?  Did someone say Harry?

RON

GINNY

Me, nosy.  Is he up there with 
you?

RON

‘Course not.  Think I’d know if my 
best friend was in my room, 
wouldn’t I?

Another door opens:  HERMIONE, in a robe, TOOTHBRUSH in 
hand.

Was that an owl I heard?

Ginny spins.  Harry.  Standing in the doorway of the 
kitchen.

Harry!

RON/HERMIONE/MRS. WEASLEY

As the others rocket downstairs, Ginny gives Harry a 
great grinning hug.  There is something oddly charged in 
the moment, a surprise to both of them.  The others 
arrive.  More hugs.

MRS. WEASLEY

But why didn’t you tell us you 
were coming?

HARRY

Didn’t know.  
(a shrug)

Dumbledore.

MRS. WEASLEY

That man.  But then, what would we 
do without him?  Ron!

Ron is about to touch Hermione.  She retracts her neck.

RON

He gestures to the stray lace of toothpaste on Hermione’s 
chin.  Quickly she wipes it off, gives him an odd look.

EXT. THE BURROW - ATTIC - NIGHT (LATER)

The Daily Prophet tumbles within a makeshift campfire of 
BLUE FLAMES, but magically doesn’t disintegrate.  Harry 
teases the fire with the tip of his wand, where The 
Chosen One? mingles with Draco’s haunted face in the 
flames.

HARRY

HERMIONE

A few days ago.  Though... for a 
bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.

Harry looks up, sees her glance at Ron.

RON

Mum sort of lost it last week.  
Said Ginny and I had no business 
going back to Hogwarts.  That it’s 
too dangerous.

Oh come on...

HARRY

HERMIONE

She’s not alone.  Even my parents  
-- and they’re Muggles -- know 
something bad is happening.

RON

Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her 
she was being barmy.  Took a day 
or two, but she came round.

HARRY

But we’re talking about Hogwarts.  
Dumbledore. What could be safer?

Hermione and Ron exchange another glance.

HERMIONE

There’s been a lot of chatter 
lately.  That he’s gotten... old.

Rubbish.  He’s only -- what?

HARRY

RON

A hundred and fifty.  Give or take 
a few years.

Silence.  Nods.  Then the three break out laughing.  Grow 
quiet again.  Harry takes another poke at the Prophet.  
Draco’s haunted face appears briefly, then is gone.

It’s utter madness:  Ever-Bashing Boomerangs whip through 
the air, Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous Wet-Start No-Heat 
fireworks spit sparks, and Nose-Biting Teacups bare tiny 
porcelain teeth.  FRED & GEORGE WEASLEY, in SCREAMING 
MAGENTA, stand upon a counter, selling to the masses:

We’ve got Fainting Fancy...

GEORGE

Nosebleed Nougats...

And just in time for school...

GEORGE

Puking Pastilles!

A BOY stops chewing, turns PALE GREEN -- literally.  

Into the cauldron, handsome.

FRED/GEORGE

Together, with the tips of their toes, Fred and George 
launch a SLOSHING CAULDRON down the counter, drop down on 
either side of Harry, begin to steer him through the 
store.

What’d you think, Harry?

FRED

Amazing.

HARRY

GEORGE

(to a browsing boy)

Pocket that and you’ll pay in more 
than Galleons, my friend.  

FRED/GEORGE

We’ve got eyes in the back of our
heads.

The boy, working a SCREAMING YO-YO, blanches as Fred and 
George turn, reveal they do in fact have EYES IN THE BACK 
OF THEIR HEADS -- phony, but unnerving.  As the EYES
WINK, the tiny boy bolts.

Bloody urchins.

Ginny and Hermione, who peruse a display of “Wonder Witch

Yes, they do really work.

HERMIONE

Inside a cage, small round BALLS of FLUFF roll about, 
SQUEAK.

FRED

Aren’t they now.  Pygmy Puffs.  
Can’t breed them fast enough.

Just then a HUGE BOY (CORMAC McLAGGEN) passes behind 
Hermione and, with his eyes, takes the full measure of 
her.  Noticing, she turns, receives a faint smile as he 
moves on.

How much for this?

EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

25

The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY -- Welcome to Diagon 
Alley! -- as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath.  All 
around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or 
SHATTERED.  People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of 
the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY 
POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST.  Bellatrix is 
there:  “KNOWN DEATH EATER,”  And Greyback:  “WEREWOLF.”  
And LUCIUS MALFOY:  “CAUGHT.”

HERMIONE

How is it Fred and George are 
doing it?  Half the alley’s closed 
down.

RON

Fred reckons people need a laugh 
these days.

HARRY
Reckon he’s right...

Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking half-
smile.

Oh no.  Look.

HERMIONE

Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that is 
Ollivander’s Wand Shop.

HERMIONE

But everyone got their wands from 
Ollivander.  Young.  Old...

Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...

HARRY

Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause, 
glance around, then slip quickly down an alley.

RON

Is it just me?  Or do Draco and 
mummy look like two people who 
don’t want to be followed?

EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - DIAGON ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON

The trio trail Draco and Narcissa, who navigate these 
dark streets with ease.  Hermione, lagging a bit, glances 
up at the darkening sky.  When she looks back, she sees 
Ron and Harry far ahead.  They turn a shadowy corner, 
vanish.

Harry and Ron duck inside a shop front.  At the end of 
the alley, a single shop glimmers dully:  Borgin & 
Burkes.  Narcissa and Draco enter, greet a STOOPED MAN 
(BORGIN).  He POINTS.  Draco walks to a LACQUERED 
CABINET, plays his fingers over its glassy surface.  
Narcissa speaks and Draco turns, finds Borgin holding the 
curtain to the back room aside.  Draco hesitates, then 
follows his mother through.

What’re they playing at?

RON

Dunno.  Let’s get closer.

HARRY

RON

(a nod; stopping)
Hey.  Where’s Hermione?

NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER ALLEY - DUSK

Hermione moves through the shadows, alone, peering down 
side streets, each darker than the next, lost, but 
holding it together, when... a SHADOW FLICKERS overhead.  
She looks up, sees a FIGURE (Greyback) leap from one roof 
to another.  She stands perfectly still, then... hears 
VOICES.

NEW ANGLE - OTHER ALLEYS - DUSK

Harry and Ron race down one passage then another.  Stop.

RON

Harry, where is she?
HARRY

I don’t know.  I’m turned around.

NEW ANGLE - BORGIN & BURKES - BACK COURTYARD - DUSK

Hermione creeps to the end of a narrow passage, toward 
the VOICES, and finds herself... behind Borgin & Burkes.  
FIGURES encircle an old cauldron, among them Greyback, 
Bellatrix, Narcissa, and in the very center... Draco.

Hermione squints against the brilliance of the FIRE, the 
FIGURES twisting like Giacomettis.  Draco extends his 
left arm... when a SHADOW falls over Hermione, fingers 
find her arm.  She wheels, terrified.

her chest.

LUNA

There’s an article on Wrackspurts 
this month.  Quibbler...?

The loitering STUDENTS ignore her, including DEAN THOMAS, 
currently WHISPERING to Ginny, who smiles mildly, more 
interested in the PURPLE PYGMY PUFF perched on her 
shoulder.

HERMIONE

Harry is under the impression that 
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

RON

You’re barking.  What would You-

Malfoy?

So what’s he doing in Borgin and 
Burke’s?  Browsing for furniture?

RON

It’s a creepy shop.  He’s a creepy 
bloke.

A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining 
the interior a deep scarlet.  Students read, play cards.  
In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.  
As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR 
SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge.  He watches 
them when a VOICE causes him to turn back.  As the 
accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting 
with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a 
sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI).

Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the 
accordion doors.  As they begin to close, slowly, Harry 
reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK 
LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley.  He eyes Malfoy, eyes 
the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump 
into the air.  It soars through the narrowing crease of 
the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- just 
as it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes 
softly, raining DARK POWDER.

darkness eerily recedes, the red light of dusk returns 
and Malfoy is revealed, standing in the DOORWAY of the 
car.  As he looks on warily, students return to their 
seats.  Across the way, Crabbe & Goyle continue to 
slumber.

What just happened?  Blaise?

She pats the seat.  Draco eyes the bag, slings it back 
onto the luggage rack and plops down.  Pansy strokes his 
hair.

MALFOY

Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse 
for a school.  I think I’d pitch 
myself off the Astronomy Tower if 
I thought I had to continue on for 
another two years.

Pansy, gently twisting one of Draco’s locks, stops.

What’s that supposed to mean?

PANSY

Let’s just say I don’t think 
you’ll be seeing me wasting my

Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively.

MALFOY

Amused, Blaise?  We’ll see just 
who’s laughing in the end.

Blaise shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the 
window at the darkness.  Just then the small bag in the

Malfoy slides shut the door.  LETS THE BLINDS DOWN.  A 
beat.

MALFOY

Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s 
bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter?  
Petrificus Totalus!

Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack.  
Something hits the floor with a THUMP.  The Invisibility 
Cloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the 
floor.  Malfoy grins.

MALFOY

Oh, right, she was dead before you 
could wipe the drool off your 
chin.

Malfoy brings his boot down hard on Harry’s face.  SNAP!  
Blood squirts from Harry’s nose.  Malfoy snatches up the 
Invisibility Cloak, pitches it over Harry.

Enjoy the ride back to London.

Harry and Luna turn.  Draco stands amidst a mountain of 
TRUNKS and OWL CAGES, watching Filch pass a long SECURITY 
DETECTOR over a WALKING STICK.

FILCH

And what exactly would you be 
wanting with a walking stick?

SNAPE
It was his father’s.

Snape separates from the shadows.  Draco eyes him warily, 
then snatches the stick from Filch.

Is my father’s.  He’s not dead.

MALFOY

Snape watches Malfoy carefully wrap the stick in felt, 
lay it back inside his trunk.

SNAPE

It’s alright, Mr. Filch.  I can 
vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off, 
catches Harry looking.

Nice face, Potter.

Harry puts a hand to his nose, watches Malfoy disappear 
into the darkness, trailed by Snape.

clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full

welcoming the newest member of our

MILD APPLAUSE ensues.  Harry claps perfunctorily, his 
eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair of 
Aurors station themselves just outside.

DUMBLEDORE

Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to 
say, has agreed to resume his old 
post of Potions master.  Meanwhile 
the post of Defense Against the 
Dark Arts will be assumed by 
Professor Snape.

This is greeted by stunned silence.  Dumbledore frowns, 
then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands 
once.  A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First

Today, of course, the world knows 
him by another name.  Which is 
why, as I stand looking out upon 
you all tonight, I am reminded of 
a sobering fact.  Each day, every 
hour, this very minute perhaps, 
dark forces attempt to penetrate 
this castle.  But in the end, 
their greatest weapon remains... 
you.

Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork 
with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of 
attention.

new, one shabby and soiled.  Both snatch for the new when 
a box -- marked “BEZOARS” -- tips.  As Harry makes a grab 
for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off 
grinning.

... is Amortentia! The most 
powerful love potion in the world.

It’s rumored to smell differently 
to each person, according to what 
attracts them.  For example, I 
smell freshly mown grass and 
new parchment and spearmint 
toothpaste --

Hermione blushes, stops herself.  Slughorn regards her.

SLUGHORN

One of my best friends is Muggle-
born.  She’s the best in our 
year...

Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook, 
looks up just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for 
confirmation.  As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously 
at him.

SLUGHORN

Now Amortentia doesn’t create 
actual love, of course.  That’s 
impossible.  But it does cause a 
powerful infatuation or obsession.  
For that reason, it is probably 
the most dangerous potion in this 
room.

Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into 
the VAPORS.  Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the 
cauldron, bringing them round.  As Ron blinks, he finds 
Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him.  Noticing, 
Hermione’s eyes narrow.

KATIE BELL

Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in 
that one.

Ah yes...

SLUGHORN

Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON.  Begins to 
ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.

SLUGHORN

What you see before you, ladies 
and gentlemen, is a curious little 
potion known as Felix Felicis.  
But it is more commonly referred 
to as --

Liquid luck.

HERMIONE

A buzz runs through the class.  Even Malfoy perks up.

SLUGHORN

Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately 
tricky to make.  Disastrous should 
you get it wrong.  But brewed 
correctly, as this has been, it 
has remarkable powers.  One sip 
and you will find that all your 
endeavors succeed... at least 
until the effects wear off.

KATIE BELL

But then why don’t people drink it 
all the time?

SLUGHORN

Because taken in excess it causes 
giddiness, recklessness and 
dangerous overconfidence.

Have you ever taken it, sir?

BLAISE

SLUGHORN

Twice.  Once when I was twenty-
four.  Once when I was fifty-
seven.  Two tablespoons taken at 
breakfast.  Two perfect days...

Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift.  Finally he 
blinks.

SLUGHORN

So.  This is what I offer each of 
you today.  One tiny vial of 
liquid luck... to the student who, 
in the hour that remains, manages 
to brew an acceptable Draught of 
Living Death, the recipe for which 
can be found on page ten of your 
textbook.

Excitement seizes the class.  Slughorn smiles knowingly.

SLUGHORN

You should know that in all the 
years of my previous tenure at 
Hogwarts, not once did a student 
brew a potion of sufficient 
quality to claim this prize.  In 
any event -- good luck.

Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERS 
in a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT.  Harry opens his book.  Frowns.  
The MARGINS of the page before him are black with the 
tight SCRIBBLINGS of a previous owner.

The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on 
and on throughout the book.  Shaking his head, Harry runs 
his finger under the first PRINTED INSTRUCTION:

43

“Cut up one Sopophorous bean.”

Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it 
over the BEAN when... Ron’s bean shoots across the room 
and bounces off Katie Bell’s head.  Harry surveys the 
rest of the room:  everyone is struggling to cut the 
resistant legume.  He glances back to his book, considers 
the instruction again.

As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to the 
margin, where a modification has been written in the 
tight scrawl:

“Crush with blade -- releases juice better.”

Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the 
flat of the blade against the bean and presses.  
Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk 
runs RED with juice.

How did you do that?

HERMIONE

Crush it.  Don’t cut it.

HARRY

HERMIONE

No.  The instructions specifically 
say to cut.

No.  Really --

Sh!

HARRY

HERMIONE

Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into 
his cauldron.  It HISSES, then turns LILAC.  Harry grins.  
CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix 
Felicis and...

MONTAGE BEGINS

Students struggle.  A cauldron overflows.  Lavender eyes 
Ron.

Hermione grows more and more frustrated.  Her hair grows 
bushier in the steam rising from her cauldron...

Harry, cool as a cucumber, adds one last ingredient, 
steps back, done...

Hermione, hair like Medea now, glowers at him...

THE LIGHT SHIFTS ONE LAST TIME.  THE VIAL GLIMMERS LIKE 
GOLD.

MONTAGE ENDS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding 
with sympathy at the fiascos before him.  Then... he 
stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly sheen of one 
bubbling potion.

SLUGHORN

Merlin’s Beard!  But it’s perfect.  
So perfect I daresay one sip would 
kill us all!  Your mother was a 
dab hand at potions, but this... 
My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy?  
Perhaps you will save us all in 
the end...

All eyes turn to Harry.  His smile falters.

SLUGHORN

Here you are then, as promised.  
One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use 
it well.

Slowly, Harry reaches out... takes the glittering vial.

reveals Harry.

DUMBLEDORE

Good evening, Harry.  You got my 
message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.

Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously.  Sits.

So.  How are you?

DUMBLEDORE

Fine, sir.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Enjoying your classes?  Professor 
Slughorn, for one, is most 
impressed with you.

HARRY

I think he overestimates my 
abilities, sir.

Do you?

DUMBLEDORE

Definitely.

HARRY

Dumbledore smiles affectionately, nods.

DUMBLEDORE

And what of your activities 
outside the classroom?  Do they 
bring you satisfaction?

Sir?

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

I notice you spend a great deal of

And we’re friends.  But... no.

In any event, I’m sure you’re

here.

Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS 
of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers.

DUMBLEDORE

What you see before you are 
memories.  In this case pertaining 
to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or 
as he was known then... Tom 
Riddle.

Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes 
a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age.

DUMBLEDORE

This vial contains a most 
particular memory -- of the day I 
first met him.  I’d like you to 
see it.  If you would...

Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises, 
gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork.  He tips 
the contents into the Pensieve.  Dumbledore nods and 
Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking 
the surface...

A horse-drawn MILK CART rattles across a RAIN-SWEPT
London street and a YOUNG DUMBLEDORE appears in a PLUM 
VELVET SUIT.  We TRACK him down the street (and see him 
eye a LOVELY LASS appreciatively) until he reaches a GRIM

A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads 
Dumbledore down a drab corridor.  CHILDREN’S VOICES carry 
from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the 
midst of some game.

*

MRS. COLE

I must confess to a bit of 
confusion upon receiving your 
letter, Mr. Dumbledore.  In all 
the years Tom’s been here, he’s 
never once had a family visitor.  
Frankly, I was stunned to find 
that someone knew of his 
existence.

DUMBLEDORE

I am not family.  But his name has 
been known to me since birth.

I see...

MRS. COLE

But she doesn’t really.  She stops, frowns.

MRS. COLE

I think I should tell you.  He’s a 
funny boy -- Tom.  Odd.  There 
have been incidents with the other 
children.  Nasty things.

DUMBLEDORE

Perhaps you could give me an 
example.

Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves 
off.  As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon 
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing, 
depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and 
a CAVE.  As he exits, we HOLD ON it.

DUMBLEDORE

Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.

MRS. COLE

Well, I’ll leave you two to 
yourselves.

Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door.  Dumbledore studies 
Riddle, then begins to tour the room.  Carefully placed 
upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS.  A grouping of 
SEVEN STONES... A book containing SEVEN MATCHES.  SEVEN 
BRASS KEYS...

Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing his 
FINGERS over its surface, as if the wood’s grain were 
Braille, as if somehow “seeing” what lies within.

Then Dumbledore pauses.  Strewn on a small table are a 
grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS.  A BOY and GIRL, their 
faces anguished.  A sea-swept CAVE.  The same cave from 
the photograph.  Dumbledore begins to reach out...

Don’t.

TOM RIDDLE

Dumbledore stops, turns.  Finds Riddle’s level gaze on 
him.

As you wish.

DUMBLEDORE

Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time, 
notices his hands.  They are splayed, utterly still, and 
INTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back 
and forth.

You’re the doctor, aren’t you?

TOM RIDDLE

No.  I am a Professor.

DUMBLEDORE

TOM RIDDLE

I don’t believe you.  I hear Mrs. 
Cole talking, her and the rest of 
the staff.  They want me looked 
at.  They think I’m different.

It’s a school.  A school of... 
magic.

Riddle stays looking, but says nothing.

DUMBLEDORE

You can do things, can’t you, Tom?  
Things the other children can’t.

Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.

Yes.

TOM RIDDLE

DUMBLEDORE

Tell me some of the things you can 
do, Tom.

TOM RIDDLE

(watching the spider)

I can make things move -- without 
touching them.  I can make animals 
do what I want without training 
them.  I can make bad things 
happen to people who are mean to 
me.  I can make them hurt... if I 
want.

Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up.

Who are you?

TOM RIDDLE

I’m like you, Tom.  Different.

DUMBLEDORE

Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.

Prove it.

It is not a request.  Without breaking his gaze, 
Dumbledore’s eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and... the

Open it.  Open.  It.

Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and 
throws open the door.  On the topmost shelf, above a rail 
of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

Take it out.

DUMBLEDORE

As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing 
the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE -- 
the only sound in the now-silent room.

DUMBLEDORE

Is there anything in that box you 
ought not to have?

Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time.  He 
spills the box onto the bed:  a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE, 
and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN.

DUMBLEDORE

Why did you want these things, 
Tom?

TOM RIDDLE

(looking off)

I like having things that belonged 
to other people.  It makes me feel 
... close to them.

Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this.

DUMBLEDORE

Thievery is not tolerated at 
Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will 
be taught not only how to use 
magic, but to control it.  
Understood?

(as Riddle nods)

I’ll be going now, Tom.  Leave 
your window open tonight.  An owl 
will bring you a message.  Read it 
carefully.

Dumbledore starts to exit, when:

I can speak to snakes too.

Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled.  Harry looks 
up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented 
face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE

Over time, while here at Hogwarts, 
Tom Riddle grew close to one 
particular teacher.  Can you guess 
which teacher that might be?

HARRY

You didn’t bring Professor 
Slughorn back simply to teach 
Potions, did you, sir?

Ron looks unnerved at this, sweating so much he’s

Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle roll

Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom 
to the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder.  
Ron, zig-zagging crazily, nearly falls off, rights 
himself in a panic, and deflects Ginny’s Quaffle... with

And... nothing.  There’s no 
reference to the Half-Blood Prince 
anywhere.

Good.  That settles it then.

HARRY

Hermione starts to object, when:

Hey, you three!

HAGRID

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       52.

CONTINUED:
HAGRID emerges out of the trees, beard crusted in white, 
looking like a crazed Father Christmas.  Behind him, deep 
in the woods, DARK SILHOUETTES -- AURORS -- can be seen.  
Hermione eyes them briefly, then nods to the PULSATING 
BURLAP BAG Hagrid clutches in his fist. 

52

What’ve you got there, Hagrid?

HERMIONE

Hagrid tips open the bag.  The trio grimace.  Hagrid 
CHUCKLES.

HAGRID

Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right 
off yer chin.  Trees ‘ere are 
drippin’ with it.

HERMIONE

Stinksap?  You’re not sick, are 
you?

HAGRID

It’s not fer me.  It’s fer Aragog.  
Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh?

RON

Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten 
feet wide?

HAGRID

Tha’s the one.  He’s taken ill.  
I’m hopin’ ter nurse ‘im back.  
Keep yer fingers crossed.

Hagrid crosses his fingers.  Ron forces a grin, does the 
same, shakes his head as Hagrid disappears back into the 
trees.

RON

Barking.  Does he not remember 
that raving arachnid tried to eat 
us? What?

Ron sees Hermione staring at the Aurors again.

HERMIONE

The Aurors. I know they’re here 
to protect us, but... somehow I 
don’t feel any safer.

Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the 
Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way.

INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS - DAY (LATER)

As the trio enter, Harry glances round, locates Slughorn 
at the bar, planted plumply on a stool.

52

53

No.  Over here.

HARRY

Hermione and Ron, in the midst of seating themselves at a 
perfectly acceptable -- and clean -- table, see Harry 
seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a 
previous customer -- but which puts him in direct view of 
Slughorn.  They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.  
Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry -- 
blocking his view.

No, no.  Sit next to me.

HARRY

Ron stops, exchanges another glance with Hermione.

O-kay.

RON

A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG 
upon the table -- which begins to wipe the surface on its 
own.  Harry cranes his neck around the kid to keep 
Slughorn in view.

What’ll we have?

SKINNY KID

HERMIONE

Three Butterbeers.  Splash of 
ginger in mine, please.

The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket.  
Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco.  
They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.

RON
Aw, bloody hell...

Harry turns, sees Ron glowering at Ginny, who sits in a 
dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a guttering 
candle.

HERMIONE

Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They’re 
just holding hands...

HERMIONE (CONT'D)

Ginny)
And snogging.

RON
I’d like to leave.

Leave?  You can’t be serious.

HERMIONE

That happens to be my sister.

RON

HERMIONE

So?  What if she looked over here 
and saw you snogging me?  Would 
you expect her to get up and 
leave?

Ron blinks, utterly speechless.  Then:

Harry, m’boy!

SLUGHORN

Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and 
catches Harry looking.  As Slughorn waddles over, 
SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an 
action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards 
him with amused curiosity.

Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you.

HARRY

Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths:  
wonderful to see you?

So what brings you here, sir?

HARRY

SLUGHORN

Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go 
way back.  Longer than I’d care to 
admit.  In fact, I remember when 
it was simply One Broomstick!

As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as 
well.  Slughorn’s belly trembles next to Hermione’s cheek 
and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.

Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!

SLUGHORN

Hermione smiles thinly, when a WHISTLE is heard and the 
FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorn’s mess as the 
SKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table.

SLUGHORN

Listen, m’boy.  In the old days, I 
used to throw together the 
occasional supper and invite a 
select student or two.  Would you 
be game?

I’d consider it an honor, sir.

HARRY

You’d be welcome too, Granger.

SLUGHORN

Hermione, in the midst of emptying her Butterbeer in one 
long draw, SLAMS down her mug -- leaving behind a 
“mustache.”

Be delighted, sir.

HERMIONE

SLUGHORN

Brilliant.  Look for my owl.

(exiting, to Ron)

Good to see you, Wallenby.

Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry.

What’re you playing at?

RON

HARRY

Dumbledore asked me to... get to 
know him.

Get to know him?

RON

HARRY

Dunno.  But it must be important.  
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.

Slam!  Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug 
as well.  Ron gestures to her upper lip.

Um... You’ve got a little...

RON

Without a thought, she flicks her tongue up, wipes it 
clean.

EXT. ROAD (OUTSIDE HOGSMEADE) - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

54

The snow falls heavily now.  Ron and Harry walk together, 
while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting 
happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue.

RON

Bit worried about her.  Did you 
hear that rubbish she was talking 
back in the pub?  Her and me 
snogging.  Ha.  As if...

LEANNE (O.S.)

Katie.  You don’t know what it 
could be!

Up ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting 
snow, ARGUING.  Katie holds a SLENDER PACKAGE.  Hermione 
comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys.

What’s up?

HERMIONE

At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE 
AIR.  Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face 
remains eerily placid.  Then she... SCREAMS.  Harry and 
Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles.  At their touch, she 
FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED 
UP in her skull.

LEANNE

I warned her!  I warned her not to 
touch it!

Hermione looks.  Lying in the snow is the PACKAGE, TORN.

RON

Harry, she’s swallowing her  
tongue -- 

I’ll get someone -- 

HERMIONE

There’s no time!

HARRY

Suddenly, a MASSIVE FIGURE LURCHES out of the WHITE:  
Hagrid.

Get back!  All o’ yeh!

HAGRID

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       57.

CONTINUED:
He says this so forcefully the others instantly obey.  
Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie’s thrashing body and 
then, as if calming a terrified animal, presses his face 
close to hers and WHISPERS with great TENDERNESS:

54

Now, now.  Now, now...

HAGRID

Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like 
a mantra, until Katie’s lids flutter and her body goes 
limp.

HAGRID

Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the 
wrappin’s.  Unnerstan’?

Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow.  Harry 
kneels.  Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL 
NECKLACE.  Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds 
package and rises.  Then, along with the others, he 
watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms.  In 
seconds they are swallowed by the snow.  The only sound 
is the ROAR of the WIND.

55

INT. McGONAGALL’S OFFICE - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)

55

The necklace lies green and glittering upon McGonagall’s 
desk.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

You’re sure Katie did not have 
this in her possession when she 
entered the Three Broomsticks, 
Leanne?

LEANNE

It’s like I said.  She went to the 
loo and when she came back she had 
the package.  She said it was 
important she deliver it.

Did she say to whom?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Leanne shakes her head.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

All right, Leanne.  You may go.

(as Leanne exits)

Why is it always you three?  Hm?

for six years.

Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio.

Severus.

Is this it?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

SNAPE

McGonagall nods.  Snape takes his wand, lifts the 
necklace like a dead snake.  Eyes it with fascination.

What do you think?

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

SNAPE

I think Miss Bell is lucky to be 
alive.

HARRY

She was cursed, wasn’t she?  I 
know Katie.  Off the Quidditch 
pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly.  If 
she was bringing that to someone, 
she wasn’t doing it knowingly.

Snape eyes Harry levelly.

Yes.  She was cursed.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

It was Malfoy.

HARRY

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That’s a very serious accusation, 
Potter.

Indeed.  Your evidence?

SNAPE

I... just... know.

HARRY

Harry and Ron lie awake in the darkened dormitory.  Ron 
stares at the ceiling.  Harry eyes “Malfoy” on the 
Marauder’s Map.

RON

What do you suppose Dean sees in 
her?  Ginny.

What does she see in him?

HARRY

Dean?  He’s brilliant.

RON

HARRY

You called him a slick git not 
five hours ago.

RON

Yeah, well, he was running his 
hands all over my sister, wasn’t 
he?  Something snaps.  You’ve got 
to hate him.  You know, on 
principle.

HARRY

(troubled by this)

I suppose.

So what is it?  He sees in her?

RON

HARRY

I don’t know.  She’s smart.  
Funny.  Attractive...

Attractive?

RON

You know.  She’s... got nice skin.

HARRY

RON

Skin?  You’re saying Dean’s dating 
my sister because of her skin?

Wouldn’t you say?  As skin goes, I 
mean.

HARRY

I’ve never really thought about 
it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very 
nice.

Another silence.  Suddenly it feels weird.

HARRY

I think I’ll be going to sleep 
now.

Right.

Harry sets the Map aside.  We HOLD.  Malfoy’s DOT moves 
down the 7th Floor corridor... and disappears.

A toast!

Slughorn stands at the head of a table, goblet raised to 
the students seated before him, which in addition to 
Harry and Hermione include MARCUS BELBY, Blaise Zabini, 
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM and the TWINS.  A distinctive CRYSTAL 
HOURGLASS sits in the center of the table.

To Hogwarts’ best and brightest!

SLUGHORN

Here, here!

CORMAC

Hermione exchanges a wry glance with Harry, who notices 
that ONE SETTING is EMPTY.  The twins make -- and drink -- 
their toast in perfect unison.  Neville stares hopelessly 
at the vast array of forks, knives and spoons placed 
beside his plate.

Which one do I use for the soup?

So tell me, Cormac.  See much of

Yes, sir.  In fact, I’m meant to

Minister for Magic over holiday.

SLUGHORN

Well, be sure to give them both my 
best.  What about your uncle, 
Belby?  Working on anything new?

(to the others)

For those of you who don’t know, 
Marcus’ uncle invented the 
Wolfsbane Potion.

As he speaks, Belby never once looks up from his plate.

MARCUS BELBY

Dunno.  He and me dad don’t get 
on. Probably because Dad thinks 
potions are rubbish.  Says the 
only potion worth having is a 
stiff one at the end of the --

SLUGHORN

And you, Miss Granger?  What is it 
your family does in the Muggle 
world?

HERMIONE

My parents are dentists.  They 
tend to people’s teeth.

SLUGHORN

Fascinating.  And is that 
considered a dangerous profession?

No.  Though, a boy named Robbie 
Fenwick did bite my father once.  
Needed ten stitches.

Nonsense.  You have nothing to

they’re unlikely to make the 
shelf.

Slughorn steps to a makeshift bar, begins to construct a 
drink.

The shelf, sir?

HARRY

Slughorn gestures to the PHOTOGRAPHS seen earlier, now 
ranged like a menagerie atop a low bookcase.  Once again, 
Lily Potter and Regulus Black up front.

SLUGHORN

Anyone who aspires to be anyone 
hopes to end up here.  Then 
again... you are already someone 
aren’t you, Harry?

HARRY

I don’t really know how to answer 
that, sir.

SLUGHORN

Your mother was modest too.  Your 
father not so much.  As you can 
see, he did not make the shelf.

Slughorn smiles genially, turns back to his drink, using 
a pair of TONGS to drop ice into his glass.

HARRY

Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, 
sir?

Slughorn stiffens, his back to Harry.  His hand trembles 
and the ice slips from the tongs.  Harry notices.

I’m sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He

Harry stops, frowns.  Slughorn turns, studies Harry.  
Nods.

SLUGHORN

Of course.  It’s only natural that 
you should want to know more.  I’m 
afraid I must disappoint you, 
Harry.  When I first met young Mr. 
Riddle, he was simply a quiet, 
albeit brilliant, boy committed to 
becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not 
unlike the others I’ve known.  In 
fact, not unlike... you.  If the 
monster existed, it was buried 
deep within.

way.

Ron nods shortly, then Seamus comes up on his side, 
WHISPERS CONSPIRATORIALLY.

SEAMUS

Counting on you, Ron.  I’ve two 
Galleons on Gryffindor.

As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the 
Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.  
One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS 
something.  A few turn, snigger.  Ron averts his eyes
and... almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain 
as he passes.  Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry 
and Hermione.  Harry eyes him briefly, knowingly, pushes 
a plate across.  Ron takes a fork, pokes at it glumly.

eye, extends a SHAKING HAND to indicate Ron’s mental 
state.

Hermione blinks, surprised by Harry’s callousness.  Ron 
is surprised as well -- and mildly put out.

Instantly, Slytherin snatches the Quaffle and rushes en 
masse toward Gryffindor’s end, weaving and passing with 
wicked skill, culminating in a vicious, slicing shot on 
goal.  Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron 
streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in 
the opposite direction.  Ginny pauses on her broom, 
stunned.

What’s gotten into him?

GINNY

She glances up at Harry, circling high above and he 
grins.  Just then, Dean streaks by:

Ginny!  Let’s go!

DEAN

Instantly, she rolls backward, jets off and races down

on the far wing -- starts the Quaffle “up the line” until 
it lands in Ginny’s hand.

As the birds hit the door, they EXPLODE SOFTLY into small 
FEATHER CLOUDS and Hermione covers her face and SOBS.  
Harry goes to her, hesitates, then tentatively drapes his 
arm over her.  As she turns her face into his chest, he 
pulls her closer, watching as, across the room, the last 
scarlet feather drifts to the floor, joining the pool 
already there.

HARRY
It feels like this.

EXT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT

64

THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione 
within.  As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the 
FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS.  In the Common Room, the 
party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls 
Ron into a kiss.  Figures pass by windows, including one 
tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR:  
Malfoy.  As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW 
and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow.

65

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Tinsel decks the banisters and mistletoe droops from the 
ceiling.  As Ron and Harry make their way down the 
crowded corridor, passing the BIRDCAGE, Ron walks with a 
new air of confidence, not exactly strutting, but close.

RON

Look, I can’t help it if she’s got 
her knickers in a twist.  What Lav 
and I have -- well, let’s just say 
there was no stopping it.  It’s 
chemical.  Will it last?  Who 
knows?  Point is, I’m a free 
agent.

66

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Harry trails Hermione through the stacks.

HERMIONE

He’s at perfect liberty to kiss 
whomever he likes.  I really 
couldn’t care less.  Was I under 
the impression that he and I would 
be attending Slughorn’s Christmas 
party together?  Yes.  Of course, 
now, given the circumstances, I’ve 
had to make other arrangements.

HARRY

I just thought, you know, since 
neither one of us can take who 
we’d really like... maybe we’d go 
together.  As friends.

HERMIONE

(stopping)

Why didn’t I think of that?

HARRY

So who are you taking?
HERMIONE

(evasively)

Um... it’s a surprise.  Besides, 
it’s you we need to worry about.  
And you can’t pick just anyone.  
See that girl over there.  That’s 
Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she’s 
trying to slip you a love potion.

Really...?

HARRY

Harry considers a fine-boned GIRL with RAVEN HAIR 
(ROMILDA VANE).  She is exquisite, an absolute work of...

HERMIONE

(snapping fingers)

Hey! She’s only interested in you 
because she thinks you’re the

Hermione cocks her head at him, exasperated.

HARRY

Okay.  Kidding.  I’ll just ask 
someone I like.  Someone cool.

INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDOR - NIGHT

67

Luna Lovegood, decked out in a set of SPANGLED SILVER 
ROBES, and Harry, in basic black, make their way toward 
the STRAINS of CHRISTMAS MUSIC, RED LANTERNS lighting 
their way.

LUNA

I’ve never been to this part of 
the castle.  At least not while 
awake.  I sleepwalk, you see.  
It’s why I wear shoes to bed.

As Harry and Luna pass out of sight, we PICK UP Malfoy, 
standing in the shadows of an alcove.  He watches them 
go, then moves off.

68

INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME TIME -   
NIGHT

In the f.g., the BIRDCAGE glimmers dully in the gray 
moonlight streaming through a window.  Within, the TWO 
BIRDS huddle quietly.  We RACK FOCUS and see, THROUGH the 
grid of wire, a FIGURE APPROACHING.

Draco moves down the corridor, eyes fixed oddly ahead.  
He looks pale in the moonlight.  In his fist he grips an 
APPLE.  As he passes the cage, we HOLD ON the BIRDS.

Draco approaches.  Stops.  Turns to the wall.  Closes his 
eyes.

INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)

CAMERA GLIDES PAST dozens of TOWERING SHELVES, dust-
strewn and listing like dominoes, cluttered with all 
matter of strange OBJECTS.  Draco appears, his legs 
pushing him on, wending his way through the narrow 
passages.

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND LARGE RECTANGULAR MASS

We RISE ABOVE it, watch Draco walk directly TOWARD us and 
stop.  He stares at the solid mass before him.  Reaches 
out and takes the fringe of the tapestry covering it.  
Tugs.  The tapestry shivers like water to the floor, 
revealing...

A CABINET, identical to the one in Borgin & Burkes.

CONTINUED:
Draco runs a hand over the glossy finish, comes away with 
DUST upon his fingertips.  Glancing around, he spies a 
BUST of a WOMAN wearing a TIARA, removes the SILK SCARF 
hanging from her porcelain neck and gently wipes the dust 
away from the cabinet.  Bringing the apple up, he opens 
the cabinet and places it within.  Shuts it.  Closing his 
eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible.

70

He reaches out.  Opens it.  The apple is gone.  He closes 
the cabinet again.  Waits.  Longer this time.  Finally, 
he opens it.  Removes the apple.  Rotates it.

Someone has taken a BITE out of it.

71

INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

71

FLASH!  A CAMERA POPS, reveals Harry smiling with 
Slughorn before a PHOTOGRAPHER (ADRIAN).  The ceiling and 
walls are draped with HANGINGS of emerald, crimson and 
gold, so the room feels like a tent... or the inside of a 
gift box.  It is LOUD and packed with people.

SLUGHORN

Thank you, Adrian!

(quietly to Harry)

One of mine.  Class of ‘78.  I had 
hoped for more out of him, but at 
least the pictures are in focus.

(suddenly)

Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must 
greet the new Minister of Magical 
Transportation.  Class of ‘67.

(as he goes)

Mingle, m’boy!  Mingle!  We’re all 
friends here.  And we run the 
world.

Harry watches Slughorn make a beeline across the room, 
along the way nodding to the twins, who have apparently 
come with each other.

Drink?

VOICE (O.S.)

Harry turns, finds Neville standing with a tray.

Neville...?

As Neville turns away, Harry notices a pair of GIRL’S 
FEET protruding from beneath a CRIMSON HANGING.  His gaze 
rises, finds Hermione peeking out. As he moves off, we 
see Luna talking to a small, stout bespectacled man 
(ELDRED WORPLE).

71

ELDRED WORPLE

Lovegood, did you say?  I once 
encountered a seriously unbalanced 
man by that name at a book 
signing.  Claimed to run a 
magazine...

NEW ANGLE - HERMIONE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SECONDS LATER

What’re you doing?

HARRY (O.S.)

Hermione YELPS, turns, pulls Harry behind the hanging.  
Her hair is slightly askew, her lipstick a bit blurry.

And what’s happened to you?

HARRY

HERMIONE

Hm?  Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I 
mean, left Cormac.  Under the 
mistletoe.

Cormac!  That’s who you invited!

HARRY

HERMIONE

I thought it would annoy Ron most.  
But he’s a menace.  He’s got more 
tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.

Dragon tartar?

WAITER (O.S.)

They turn, find a WAITER peeking in, tray in hand.

No thank you.

HERMIONE

WAITER

Just as well.  They give one 
horribly bad breath.

On second thought -- maybe it’ll 
keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here 
he comes!

Snape, looking bored, stands on the periphery of a 
conversation, when he sees Hermione exit one side of the 
hanging and Cormac enter the other.

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SAME TIME

HARRY

I think she went to powder her 
nose.

Harry looks past Cormac’s shoulder, out past the hanging 
and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest.  Cormac plucks a 
dragon blob off the tray in Harry’s hand, pops it.

CORMAC

Slippery little minx, your friend.  
Likes to work her mouth too, 
doesn’t she?  Yak yak yak. What 
is this I’m eating, by the way?

Dragon balls.

HARRY

As Cormac’s face freezes, Harry starts to head toward 
Slughorn when the HANGING IS SWEAP ASIDE:  Snape.

What’s going on back here?

SNAPE

Cormac SPEWS raw dragon all over Snape’s shoes.  Snape 
surveys the damage, then his eyes rise darkly.

SNAPE

You’ve just bought yourself a 
month’s detention, McLaggen.

McLaggen dashes off.  Harry makes to follow.

Not so quick, Potter.

A message...?

HARRY

SNAPE

From Professor Dumbledore.  He 
asked that I give you his best and 
that he hopes you enjoy your 
holiday.  You see, he’s traveling 
and won’t return until term 
resumes.

Traveling?  Where?

HARRY

Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then 
exits, taking Harry’s gaze with him, to Slughorn once 
again, wildly gesturing with a full glass of wine.

MALFOY (O.S.)

Take your hands off me,  you 
filthy squib!

A frown overtakes Slughorn’s face and he turns toward the 
source of the commotion, exits Harry’s view.  Harry 
emerges from the hanging, finds Malfoy in Filch’s rough 
grip.

FILCH

Professor Slughorn, sir!  I’ve 
just discovered this boy lurking 
in an upstairs corridor.  He 
claims to have been invited to 
your party.

MALFOY

Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing.  
Happy?

Filch.

encircles it with a HEART, mimes “I miss you,” and exits 
with a pout.

Lovely.

All she wants to do is snog me.  
My lips are getting chapped.  
Look.

Just then, Hermione passes by, breaks stride as she spots 
Lavender’s handiwork, then continues on.  Ron shakes his

Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy 
for a mission?

I know it sounds mad --

Has it occurred to you, Harry, 
that Snape was simply pretending 
to offer Draco help so that he 
could find out what he’s up to?

That’s not what it sounded like.

HARRY

TONKS

Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus.  To 
make an Unbreakable Vow, after  
all --

LUPIN

It comes down to whether or not 
you trust Dumbledore’s judgement.  
He trusts Snape.  Therefore, I do.

HARRY

But Dumbledore can make mistakes.  
He’s said it himself --

You’re blinded by hatred.

-- was a Vanishing Cabinet.

HARRY
A Vanishing Cabinet?

MR. WEASLEY

They were all the rage when 
Voldemort first rose to power.  
You can imagine the appeal.  
Should the Death Eaters come 
calling, one needed only slip 
inside and disappear for an hour 
or two.  But they’re tricky 
contraptions.  Require a 
tremendous amount of looking 
after.  Eventually they fell out 
of favor.

Nothing.  It’s still there.

Harry nods, pondering this.

MR. WEASLEY

Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly.

Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers 
into the smoking marsh.  A HUGE FIGURE QUIVERS through a 
veil of smoke.  Ginny’s eyes SHIFT, see Bellatrix racing 
forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of 
smoke evaporates, reveals... Greyback.  Bellatrix makes 
an ODD, CLICKING noise -- like a signal -- and Greyback 
edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him 
and revealing...

No, Harry!  It’s a trap!

Harry falters, looking toward Ginny’s voice and spies 
Greyback.  Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks 
and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE.  Raising her wand, 
she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER 
of SPARKS around Ginny.  Ginny fires back, then wheels 
away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face 
with...

Greyback, sharp teeth glittering.

GREYBACK

into the reeds and sees Harry and Ginny, wands poised.  
He grins... when Bellatrix’s odd, CLICKING signal carries 
through the night once again.  Turning away, he exits.

Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at 
each other wordlessly.  Then... Ron, Fred, George, Arthur

16-YEAR-OLD TOM RIDDLE and five other BOYS.  The CRYSTAL 
HOURGLASS sits on a side table.

TOM RIDDLE

Sir, is it true that Professor 
Merrythought is retiring?

Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at 
Riddle.

SLUGHORN

Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I 
knew, could I?  I must say, m’boy, 
I’d like to know where you get 
your information.  More 
knowledgeable than half the staff, 
you are.

(as the other boys 
laugh)

By the way, thank you for the 
pineapple -- you’re quite right, 
it is my favorite -- how is it you 
knew?

Intuition.

TOM RIDDLE

Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition had 
nothing to do with it.  Slughorn chuckles uneasily.

SLUGHORN

Good gracious, look at the time.  
Off you go, boys, or Professor 
Dippett will have us all in 
detention.  Lestrange, Avery, 
don’t forget your essays...

As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some 
papers when -- Ping! -- he turns, finds Riddle still 
there, standing by the crystal hourglass.

SLUGHORN

Look sharp, Tom.  You don’t want 
to be caught out of bed after 
hours...

I know a secret shortcut or two.

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN

Yes, I imagine you do.  Something 
on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, sir.  I couldn’t think of 
anyone else to go to.  The other 
professors, well, they’re not like 
you.  They might... misunderstand.

Go on.

SLUGHORN

Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins to 
roll it between his fingers.  It is set with a BLACK 
STONE.

TOM RIDDLE

I was in the library the other 
night, in the Restricted section, 
and I read something rather odd, 
about a bit of rare magic, and I 
thought perhaps you could 
illuminate me...

Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN’S 
VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK:

The FOG grows thicker and...

INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

88

... CAMERA EMERGES FROM the swirling Pensieve.  Harry 
blinks, finds Dumbledore studying him from across the 
room.

DUMBLEDORE

Confused?  I would be surprised if 
you weren’t.

HARRY

I don’t understand -- what 
happened?

DUMBLEDORE

This is perhaps the most important 
memory I’ve collected.  It’s also 
a lie.

(off Harry’s look)

This memory has been tampered 
with.  In this case by the person 
whose memory it is, our friend 
Professor Slughorn.

HARRY

But why would he tamper with his 
own memory?

I suspect he is ashamed of it.

DUMBLEDORE

Why?

Why indeed.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve.  

DUMBLEDORE

I asked you to get to know 
Professor Slughorn and you’ve done 
so.

Now I want you to persuade him to 
divulge his true memory.  Any way 
you can.

I don’t know him that well, sir -- 

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

You’re the Chosen One, Harry.  And 
Horace is, at heart, a decent man.  
Provide the proper circumstances 
and he will confess his sins.

Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies 
them.  They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole.

DUMBLEDORE

This memory is everything, Harry.  
Without it, we are blind. Without 
it, we leave the fate of our world 
to chance.  You have no choice.  
You must not fail.

As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s 
hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.

89

INT./EXT. SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM - DAY

89

As the CLASS BELL RINGS, a group of FIRST YEARS rise.

SLUGHORN

Now don’t forget to look over the 
chapter on antidotes.  I’ll be 
poisoning one of you next time we 
meet.  I’m joking!  Off you go!  
Don’t forget your rattails, Miss 
Alys.

As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting 
just outside the door.  He enters.  For a moment, 
Slughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware.  
Then...

SLUGHORN

Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of 
Potions himself!  To what do I owe 
the pleasure?

HARRY

Well, sir, I wondered if I might 
ask you something.

Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!

SLUGHORN

HARRY

Well, you see, the other day I was 
in the Restricted Section -- in 
the library -- and I stumbled upon 
something rather odd while 
reading.  Something about a bit of 
rare magic...

SLUGHORN

Yes?  And exactly what was this 
rare magic.

HARRY

I’m not sure... That is, I don’t 
recall the name... exactly.  But 
it got me wondering... Are there 
some kinds of magic you’re not 
allowed to teach?

Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully.

SLUGHORN

I’m a Potions Professor, Harry.  
Perhaps your question would best 
be posed to Professor Snape.

HARRY

Yes, well, we don’t exactly see 
eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to 
say is, he’s not like you.  He 
might... misunderstand.

Recognition flickers in Slughorn’s eyes.  A glint of 
fear.

SLUGHORN

There can be no light without the 
dark.  And so it is with magic.  
Myself, I have always strived to 
live within the light.  I suggest 
you do the same.

Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit.

HARRY

Did you say the same to Tom 
Riddle, sir?  When he came asking 
questions.

Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns.

SLUGHORN

Dumbledore put you up to this.  
Didn’t he?  Didn’t he!

Lightning flashes.  Thunder rumbles.  Rain lashes the 
windows.  Through the birdcage’s grid of wires someone 
approaches.  We RACK FOCUS... FIND Harry.  As he passes, 
we HOLD ON the cage.  One bird is missing.  Only the 
BLACK one remains.  As thunder BOOMS, the bird RUFFLES 
its feathers.

Harry glances down the corridor adjacent, sees a FIGURE 
start up the far stairwell.  As the SHADOW ASCENDS, Harry 
follows.

91

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY

The FIGURE continues on, passes OUT OF VIEW.  Harry

looks back the way he came.  HARRY’S SHADOW scales the 
wall as he approaches.  Draco watches calmly, then turns, 
CLOSES HIS EYES.  And simply... DISAPPEARS.

Harry turns the corner.  Stops.  No one.

94

INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER)

94

Draco wends his way through the towering shelves, removes 
the tapestry and faces the gleaming cabinet.  He reaches 
into his coat and carefully removes the WHITE BIRD.  
Holding it in one hand, he studies it, gently stroking 
its feathers with the other.  For a moment, he seems lost 
in the activity, lost in the bird’s coal black eyes, its 
bobbing head.  Then, gently, he places it in the cabinet 
and closes the door.  Waits.

When he opens the cabinet, the bird is gone.  He closes 
the cabinet once more.

A feather, white and gleaming, clings to the cuff of his

fragile, translucent.  He looks briefly lost again, then 
blinks, turns back to the cabinet, slowly reaches out and 
opens it.  The bird is there.

INT. COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

Hermione does her homework while Harry peers at the 
Marauder’s Map.  They are the only ones present.

HERMIONE

Did you actually expect you could 
just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask 
him to reveal his deepest, darkest 
secret?  Honestly, Harry, 
sometimes I think the Daily 
Prophet should call you the Dim 
One.

Nice.

HARRY

HERMIONE

(rising to go)

You’re going to have to persuade
him somehow.  And now, I’m afraid, 
you’ve made it a lot harder.

HARRY

Hermione.  I think Malfoy’s 
leaving the castle.

Hermione stops dead, looks back at Harry.  He nods.

HARRY

I’ve seen it.  Sometimes... 
sometimes he just disappears off 
the Map.

HERMIONE

That’s... not possible.  No one 
can leave the castle these days.  
The Map is wrong.

The Map is never wrong.

Hermione frowns, thinking, then shakes her head, turns 
away.

Harry slumps into the darkened dormitory.  Stops.  On the 
floor, glittering in the moonlight, is a trail of CANDY 
FOILS.  A bit further along, Ron sits in his PJ’s upon 
the window sill, a HEART-SHAPED BOX by his side.

RON

It’s beautiful, isn’t it?  The 
moon.

HARRY

Divine.  Had ourselves a little 
late-night snack, did we?

RON

It was on your bed.  The box.  
Thought I’d try one...

Or twenty.

HARRY

RON

I can’t stop thinking about her, 
Harry.

HARRY

Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she 
was starting to annoy you.

RON

She could never annoy me.  I 
think... I think I love her.

Excuse me?

HARRY

Ron nods.  Harry looks bewildered.

Well... Brilliant.

HARRY

Do you think she knows I exist?

RON

HARRY

Bloody well hope so.  She’s been 
snogging you for three months.

RON

Snogging?  Who’re you talking 
about?

He turns to his bed, throws back the covers when... the 
heart-shaped box caroms off his head.

What the hell was that for?

HARRY

RON

It’s no joke!  I’m in love with 
her!

HARRY

Okay!  Fine!  You’re in love with 
her!  Have you ever actually met
her!

No.  Can you introduce me?

RON

Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then 
glances at the candy box at his feet.  There is an 
envelope.  Taking it, he slides out a card:  “Dear Harry.  
Thinking sweet thoughts of you.  Happy Valentine’s Day.  
Romilda.”  He suppresses a smile.

HARRY

Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- 
C’mon.  I’m going to introduce you 
to Romilda Vane.

Harry leads Ron, still in his PJs, toward a door.

the FLOOR LAMP he’d sent wobbling the night of the dinner 
party.

SLUGHORN

Yes???!!!!
Oh.  Potter.  It’s you.  I’m 
afraid I’m busy at the moment -- 

He starts to close the door.  Harry sticks his foot in.

HARRY

Sir.  I’m sorry.  I wouldn’t 
bother you if it weren’t 
absolutely -- 

Where’s Romilda?

RON

Slughorn squints over Harry’s shoulder at Ron who is 
doing precisely the same from the other side.

What’s the matter with Wenby?

Harry leans forward, WHISPERS into Slughorn’s ear.  He 
frowns.

Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.

INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

98

Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of 
powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a 
mirror.  As he paces, Harry passes “the shelf” and finds, 
front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn -- 
the one taken at the Christmas party.  In deep b.g. is 
photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching his 
POTIONS TEXTBOOK.

SLUGHORN

I’d have thought you could whip up 
a remedy for this in no time, 
Harry -- an expert potioneer like 
you.

practiced hand, sir.

Hm.  Perhaps you’re right.

furtively.

HARRY

I’m sorry, sir.  About the other 
day.  Our... misunderstanding.

Slughorn eyes Harry briefly, looks away.

SLUGHORN

Yes, well, water under the bridge 
as they say, correct?

HARRY

I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of 
it, after all these years.  The 
questions.  About... Voldemort.

Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly.

I’ll ask you not to use that name.

SLUGHORN

Slughorn’s stare is fierce.  Finally, he turns, goblet in 
hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery.

HARRY

Yes, sir.  It’s just, well, 
Dumbledore once said that fear of 
a name only increases fear of the 
thing itself.  It seemed sensible.

SLUGHORN

With all due respect, Dumbledore 
sometimes forgets that most of us 
do not possess powers so great 
that we can risk offending the 
most dangerous Dark Lord who ever 
lived.

Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one 
Dumbledore fixed Harry with.  Finally, he turns away.

butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a 
dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had 
other intentions for this but 
given the circumstances...

Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.  
As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry.

There we are, Potter.  To life!

SLUGHORN

CRASH! -- Ron’s glass hits the floor and he crumples to 
his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING
horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips.  Harry rushes to 
him.

begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking 
for something, anything.  A box tumbles, something 
spills:  a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robin’s 
egg, shriveled and dry.  Snatching one, he wrenches open 
Ron’s jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT.  Instantly 
Ron stops moving, paralyzed.  The room is suddenly 
silent.  He’s not breathing.  Harry places both hands 
behind Ron’s head and gives it a SHAKE.  Another.

Harry shakes him again and again... then stops.  Ron’s 
head rolls limply from his fingers.  Slughorn looks on, 
mouth agape.  Useless.  Then... A COUGH, a great 
hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and

birdcage and down the corridor when she pauses, turns to 
the wall and shuts her eyes.

INT. ROOM 0F REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER)

106

Ginny and Harry materialize.

The Room of Requirement...

HARRY

Ginny nods, turns away.  Harry follows.

NEW ANGLE - SECONDS LATER

Harry eyes the shelves that tower above him and the odd 
things they hold:  a SMALL CAGE bearing the SKELETON of 
some long-dead creature.  A JAR of QUIVERING EYEBALLS 
which track him as he passes.

GINNY

Over the years, if someone had a 
secret, if they wanted to conceal 
something, this is where they 
came.  Some of these things are 
almost as old as the castle 
itself.

Who showed you this?  First.

HARRY

GINNY

Fred and George.  First year.  I 
hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a 
time.  Wish I’d left it...

As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a 
SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby.  They turn, look off.

GINNY/HARRY

(at the same time)

What was that?

They turn back, look at each other.  Ginny smiles.  Then:

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND VANISHING CABINET

Harry and Ginny approach.  The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER.  
Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry.  Reacts.  
The cabinet door VIBRATES.  Slowly, he opens it and...

... the BLACK BIRD flies free in a rush of FLAPPING 
wings.

GINNY

See, you never know what you’ll 
find up here.

Harry nods, looks back to the cabinet, mystified.

GINNY

All right.  Close your eyes.  That 
way you can’t be tempted.

Ginny slips the book from his fingers and starts to back 
away.  She mouths:  Close... your... eyes.  As she leaves 
FRAME, CAMERA PUSHES EVER-SO-SLOWLY IN ON Harry.  Still.  
Waiting.  For a long moment, there is only silence.  Then 
a shadow gently eclipses Harry’s face.

GINNY

There’s something else.  Another 
secret of sorts.  One of mine...

Ginny leans in then and places her mouth on Harry’s.

106

GINNY

That can stay hidden up here too, 
if you like.

Harry opens his eyes, watches Ginny back away, then 
disappear around the corner.  He stares at the empty air, 
blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead.

107

INT. CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON (LATER)

107

Harry, looking a tad dazed, walks aimlessly.

So.  Did you and Ginny do it?

RON (O.S.)

Harry jumps, watches Ron appear.

What?

HARRY

You know.  Hide the book.

RON

Oh.  Yeah.

HARRY

Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor 
and -- spying Harry -- does a little Oliver Hardy “Oops” 
and retreats.

RON

Still no luck with Slughorn, I 
take it?

Harry shakes his head -- then stops cold, stares at the 
empty space where Slughorn stood moments before.

Say that again.

HARRY

108

INT. COMMON ROOM - DUSK

108

The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harry’s palm 
as he and Ron and Hermione huddle in the empty dormitory.  
They exchange glances, then Harry brings the vial to his 
lips.

HERMIONE
Well?  How do you feel?

HERMIONE

Now remember.  Slughorn usually 
eats early, takes a short walk and 
then returns to his office.

HARRY

Right.  I’m going down to 
Hagrid’s.

HERMIONE

What?  No, Harry -- you’ve got to 
go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --

HARRY

No.  I’ve got a good feeling about 
going to Hagrid’s.  I feel like 
it’s the place to be tonight, know 
what I mean?

No.

HERMIONE/RON

HARRY

Trust me.  I know what I’m doing.  
Or at least Felix does.

109

INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

109

A BOY with a PREFECT’S BADGE patrols the corridor.  
Bored, he ponders the progress of his FAINT MUSTACHE in a 
mirror.  Harry walks by, unseen.

110

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

110

Filch paces, standing guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly 
by.  A MOUSE appears in the OPEN helmet of a SUIT OF 
ARMOR, washes its face with its tiny paws, then spies 
Mrs. Norris -- who HISSES.  The mouse makes a quick 
retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down.  As Filch 
wheels, Harry strolls past.

111

EXT. GROUNDS/HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

111

TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds.  Harry 
approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the 
last second, something on the ground catches his eye.  He 
KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning 
helplessly.  Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny 
bug gain purchase, then tips it upright...

stops, as if compelled by some inner voice, and heads the 
opposite way.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

112

Harry HUMS placidly.  Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond 
the steamy panes of the Greenhouse.  It’s Slughorn, 
hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily, 
resisting his attentions.  Snip!  He stealthily removes a 
sprig, looks up and JUMPS.

SLUGHORN
Merlin’s beard, Harry!

HARRY

Sorry, sir.  I should’ve announced 
myself.  Cleared my throat.  
Coughed.  You probably feared I 
was Madam Sprout.

SLUGHORN
Well, yes, actually --

(paranoid)

Why would you think that?

HARRY

Just the general behavior, sir.  
The sneaking around.  The jumping 
when you saw me.  By the way, 
those Tentacula leaves -- they’re 
quite valuable, aren’t they?

SLUGHORN

Ten galleons a leaf to the right 
buyer -- not that I’m familiar 
with such back alley transactions.  
One hears rumors is all.  My own 
interests are purely academic, of 
course.

HARRY

Personally, these plants have 
always kind of freaked me out.

Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.  
Slughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly.

SLUGHORN

Exactly how did you get out of the 
castle, Harry?

HARRY

Through the front doors, sir.  I’m 
off to Hagrid’s, you see.  He’s a 
very dear friend and I felt like 
paying him a visit.  So if you 
don’t mind, I’ll be going.

It’s nearly nightfall.  Surely you

the grounds all by yourself.

HARRY

Well, then by all means come 
along, sir.

113

EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

113

Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along... 
when Slughorn appears, huffing and puffing to keep up.

SLUGHORN

Harry, I must insist you accompany 
me back to the castle immediately!

HARRY

That would be counterproductive, 
sir.

And what makes you say that?

SLUGHORN

No idea.

HARRY

Slughorn frowns impatiently -- then stops, blinks.

Merlin’s beard...

SLUGHORN

Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump.  
Nearby, Aragog’s massive body lies legs up.

Is that an actual Acromantula?

SLUGHORN

A dead one, I think, sir.

HARRY

Harry and Slughorn approach a sullen Hagrid.

I’m sorry, I... (didn’t realize.)

SLUGHORN

Slughorn falters helplessly.  Hagrid waves his hand.

HAGRID

Ah, don’ worry yerself.  Yer not 
alone.  Seriously misunderstood 
creatures -- spiders.  It’s the 
eyes, I reckon.  Unnerve people.

Not to mention the pincers.

HARRY

Harry makes a little claw motion with his hand, while 
making a CLICKING sound.  Hagrid eyes Harry curiously.

HAGRID

I reckon that too... How’d yeh get 
outta the castle anyways?

Through the front doors.

HARRY

SLUGHORN

Hagrid.  I wouldn’t want to be 
indelicate, but Acromantula venom 
is uncommonly rare and, well, if 
you wouldn’t mind my extracting a  
vial or two -- purely for academic 
pursuits...

HAGRID

Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any 
good, izzit?

SLUGHORN

My thoughts exactly!  Always carry 
a few spare ampoules for just such 
occasions.  Old Potion Master’s 
habit, you know...

Slughorn rummages about his pockets, extracts some SMALL 
VIALS -- all empty save for one containing a HAIRY WORM -- 
then scrambles up close to Aragog.  Harry and Hagrid 
watch.

113

HAGRID

Wish yeh coulda seen ‘im in ‘is 
prime.  Magnificent ‘e was.  Jus’ 
magnificent...

Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and 
SNORTS LOUDLY into it.  Slughorn looks up, studies 
Hagrid’s sorry expression with empathy and steps away.

SLUGHORN

Why don’t I say a few words?  I 
trust he had family?

Oh yeah.

HARRY

SLUGHORN

(clearing his throat)

Farewell...

Slughorn frowns.

Aragog.

HAGRID

SLUGHORN

(a nod)

Farewell, Aragog, king of 
arachnids.  Though your body will 
decay, your spirit lingers on in 
the quiet, web-spun places of your 
Forest home.  May your many-eyed 
descendents ever flourish and your 
human friends find solace for the 
loss they have sustained.

Tha’ was... tha’ was... beautiful.

HAGRID

Hagrid wipes his eyes, then rises.  He walks to Aragog, 
studies him lovingly, then puts a shoulder to the big 
beast’s body... and sends him tumbling into the freshly-
dug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK.

HAGRID/SLUGHORN (O.S.)

(singing)

And Odo the hero, they bore him 
back home...

INT. HAGRID’S HUT - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)

114

Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitchen 
table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES.  Hagrid 
and Slughorn are feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear-
eyed, focused.

HAGRID/SLUGHORN

To the place he’d known as a lad, 
They laid him to rest with his hat 
inside out and his wand snapped in 
two, which was sad...

As they finish, both men CHUCKLE.  Hagrid tops off 
everyone’s mug with a bit more wine.  Harry brings his 
mug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket at 
his feet.

HAGRID

I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know.  
Tiny little thing he was when he 
hatched.  No bigger’n a Pekinese.

SLUGHORN

Sweet.  I once had a fish.  
Francis.  Lovely little thing.  
One day I came downstairs and he’d 
vanished.  Poof.

Tha’s odd.

HAGRID

SLUGHORN

Isn’t it?  That’s life, I suppose.  
One goes along and then... poof.

Poof.

Poof.

HAGRID

HARRY

They all nod soberly.  Slughorn’s eyes rise to the 
ceiling.

That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?

SLUGHORN

Hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  Nods.

SLUGHORN

But my dear chap, do you know how 
much that’s worth?

No idea... no idea at all...

HAGRID

Thunk!  Hagrid’s great shaggy head hits the table.  
Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies 
across the table.  Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who 
merely stares back.  Slughorn averts his eyes.  Suddenly 
nervous.  A WIND rises outside.  Windowpanes rattle.

SLUGHORN

It was a student who gave me 
Francis.  One spring afternoon I 
discovered a bowl upon my desk 
with a few inches of clear water.  
There was a flower petal floating 
upon the surface.  As I watched, 
the petal sank, but just before it 
touched bottom... it transformed.  
Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful 
magic, wondrous to behold.  The 
petal had come from a lily.

Hearing “lily,” Harry looks up.  Slughorn nods.

SLUGHORN

Your mother.  The day I came 
downstairs, the day I found the 
bowl empty... was the day she...

Slughorn falters, pain etching his face.

SLUGHORN

I know what you want.  But I can’t 
give it to you.  It will ruin 
me...

Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks.

HARRY

Do you know why I survived?  The 
night I got this.

Slughorn looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar.

HARRY

Because of her.  Because she 
sacrificed herself.  Because she 
refused to step aside.  Because 
her love was more powerful than 
Voldemort.

SLUGHORN
Please don’t say his --

I’m not afraid of the name, 
Professor.  And I’m not afraid of 
him.  And you shouldn’t be either.  
She didn’t just die for me that 
night.  She died for you too.  She 
died for everyone who’s ever woken 
in the middle of the night afraid 
a Death Eater waited on their 
doorstep.

Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him.

HARRY

Professor.  I’m going to tell you 
something, something others have 
only guessed at.  It’s true.  I am 
the Chosen One.

Slughorn looks up.  Harry nods.

HARRY

Only I can kill him.  But in order 
to do so, I need to know what Tom 
Riddle asked you that night in 
your office all those years ago.  
And I need to know what you told 
him.

Slughorn’s eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.

HARRY

Be brave, Professor.  Be brave 
like my mother.  Otherwise you 
disgrace her.  Otherwise she died 
for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl 
remains empty forever.

Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle.  
Finally, slowly, he removes his wand.

SLUGHORN

Don’t think too badly of me once 
you’ve seen it.  You don’t know 
what he was like... even then.

Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one with the WORM  
-- but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to 
take it.  Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to 
his temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD.  Harry 
extends the vial and... it drops within.

Dumbledore holds the vial in wonderment.  The worm hangs 
in eerie suspension.

How is he?  Horace?

DUMBLEDORE

Harry shrugs.  Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand.  A 
LONG strand hangs suspended like glass.  A pearl forms... 
and as it hangs... Harry’s eyes shift, notice a DRAWING 
on Dumbledore’s desk, one of Tom Riddle’s drawings seen 
at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct 
OUTCROPPING.  Then... the pearl drops.

As before.  The CRACKLING EMBERS of the FIRE.  Slughorn, 
a circle of six.  Riddle commanding the room.

TOM RIDDLE

Sir, is it true that Professor 
Merrythought is retiring?

Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at 
Riddle.

SLUGHORN

Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I 
knew, could I?  I must say, m’boy, 
I’d like to know where you get 
your information.  More 
knowledgable than half the staff, 
you are.

(as the other boys 
laugh)

By the way, thank you for the 
pineapple -- you’re quite right, 
it is my favorite -- how is it you 
knew?

Intuition.

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN

(an uneasy chuckle)

Good gracious, is it that time 
already?  Off you go, boys, or

on your mind, Tom?

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, sir.  I couldn’t think of 
anyone else to go to.  The other 
Professors, well, they’re not like 
you.  They might... misunderstand.

Go on.

SLUGHORN

TOM RIDDLE

I was in the library the other 
night, in the Restricted section, 
and I read something rather odd, 
about a bit of rare magic and I 
thought perhaps you could 
illuminate me.  It’s called, as I 
understand it... a Horcrux.

Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether.

Excuse me?

SLUGHORN

TOM RIDDLE

Horcrux.  I came across the term 
while reading and I didn’t fully 
understand it.

SLUGHORN

I’m not sure what you were 
reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark 
stuff, very Dark indeed.

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to 
you.  I mean no disrespect to the 
rest of the staff, but I thought 
if anyone could tell me... it 
would be you.

A Horcrux is an object in which a 
person has concealed part of their 
soul.

TOM RIDDLE

Yes, I thought it might be 
something like that.  But I don’t 
understand how that works, sir.

SLUGHORN

One splits one’s soul and hides 
part of it in an object.  By doing 
so, you are protected should you 
be attacked and your body 
destroyed.

Protected?

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN

That part of your soul that was 
hidden, lives on.  In other words, 
you cannot die.

Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the 
MIRROR on the wall opposite.  A hint of RED glints in his 
eyes.

How does one split his soul, sir?

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN

I think you can guess the answer 
to that, Tom.

Murder.

TOM RIDDLE

SLUGHORN

Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart.  
It is a violation against nature.  
After, one is never the same.

TOM RIDDLE

Out of curiosity, sir -- can you 
only split your soul once?  For 
instance, isn’t seven the most 
powerfully magical number --

SLUGHORN

Seven!  Merlin’s beard, Tom!  
Isn’t it bad enough to think of 
killing one person?  To rip the 
soul into seven pieces...

Dumbledore holds up his withered hand, silencing him, 
turns away.  Harry studies him, waiting, the hush 
palpable.

This is beyond anything I 
imagined.  In my life I have seen 
things that are unimaginably

Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant.  Harry watches 
him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames 
above.  Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.

HARRY

Do you mean to say he succeeded, 
sir?  In making a Horcrux?

DUMBLEDORE

Oh he succeeded.  And not just 
once.  Think, Harry.  He’s just 
told us.

Riddle’s battered DIARY.

Tom Riddle’s diary --

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

It’s a Horcrux, yes.  Four years 
ago, when you saved Ginny 
Weasley’s life in the Chamber of 
Secrets, when you brought me   
this --

(holding up the 
diary)

I knew.  This was a different kind 
of magic.  Very dark.  Very 
powerful.  But until tonight, I 
had no idea just how powerful...

And the ring...?

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Belonged to Voldemort’s mother.  
It was difficult to find and...

(raising his damaged 
hand)

... even more difficult to 
destroy.

HARRY

But if you could find them all.  
If you did destroy each Horcrux...

One destroys Voldemort.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry begins to reach out for the ring...

HARRY

But how would you find them?  They 
could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t 
they...

True.  But magic, especially Dark

deep in a haunted clearing.  An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as 
it tumbles from an old woman’s hand.  A SNAKE (NAGINI) 
slithering through damp grass.  Dumbledore slipping the 
ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays...

... leaves traces.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES.  The ring 
skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand 
to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face.  
Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at 
Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching 
the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen 
fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow 
“see” into Harry’s heart.  Trepidation -- and recognition 
-- flicker over his face.

HARRY

It’s where you’ve been going, 
isn’t it, sir?  When you leave the 
school.

Harry’s eyes drift once again to the postcard on the 
desk.  Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still 
studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant.

DUMBLEDORE

Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I 
may have found another.  But this 
time I cannot hope to destroy it 
alone.

EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DYING LIGHT (LATER)

120

As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears 
VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering 
up through the grid-like floor above:  Dumbledore and 
Snape.

SNAPE

Have you ever considered that you 
ask too much?  That you take too 
much for granted?  Has it ever 
crossed your brilliant mind that I 
don’t want to do this anymore?

DUMBLEDORE

Whether it has or hasn’t is 
irrelevant.  I will not negotiate 
this with you, Severus.  You 
agreed.  There’s nothing more to 
discuss.

Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore 
squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his 
back.  Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can 
react -- is descending the stairs.  Seeing Harry, Snape 
falters briefly, then continues on without a word.  As 
his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.  
Dumbledore turns.  Smiles.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry.  You need a shave, my 
friend.

Harry runs his hand over his face.

DUMBLEDORE

At times I forget how much you’ve 
grown.  At times I still see the 
small boy from the cupboard.

(smiling)

Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I 
am an old man.

You look the same to me, sir.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Like your mother, you are 
unfailingly kind.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)

A trait people never fail to 
undervalue.  I’m afraid.

Dumbledore turns then, eyes the fiery sky again.

DUMBLEDORE

The place to which we journey 
tonight is exceedingly dangerous, 
Harry.  I promised that you could 
accompany me and I stand by that 
promise.  But there is a 
condition:  You must obey any 
command I give you -- without 
question.

Yes, sir.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Understand what I’m saying.  
Should I tell you to hide, you 
must hide.  

Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE

Should I tell you to run, you will 
run.  

Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE

And should I tell you to abandon 
me and save yourself...

Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s.

You will do so.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry hesitates.

Your word, Harry.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods.

My word.

Take my arm.

Sir, I thought one couldn’t 
Apparate within Hogwarts.

Being me has its privileges.

BILLOWS and we are TOSSED INTO...

121

EXT. OCEAN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

121

BLACK.  Undulating.  The sound of WAVES.  We EASE UP, out 
of the ocean.  A GIANT WAVE crashes over a jagged 
outcropping.  As the SPRAY clears... Dumbledore and Harry 
are revealed.  Dumbledore eyes the TOWERING CLIFF FACE 
opposite, the CAVE.

It’s there, isn’t it?

HARRY

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       121.

122

EXT. CAVE - SAME TIME - DUSK

122

Harry and Dumbledore materialize.  It is quiet here, 
eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder.  As Harry 
glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes 
beyond.  Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a 
towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the 
light from his wand.

DUMBLEDORE

This is the place.  Oh yes, this 
place has known magic.

(closing his eyes)

Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle 
once stood many, many years ago, 
when he was but a poor orphan boy 
with a penchant for cruelty...

Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face 
registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.  
He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the 
rock.

DUMBLEDORE

One wintry afternoon, he lured two 
younger classmates to this cave.  
What happened is unclear.  But 
this much is known:  the children 
were damaged.

Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his 
fingers play over the rock... then stop.  His eyes open.  
He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade 
across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet 
beads.

Sir!

HARRY

The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble, 
forming a narrow opening.

DUMBLEDORE

In order to gain passage, payment 
must be made, payment intended to 
weaken any intruder.

You should’ve let me, sir.

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much 
more precious than mine.

123

EXT. ARCHWAY/UNDERGROUND LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

123

Dumbledore and Harry emerge onto the rim of a VAST LAKE 
teeming with MIST.  A chill hangs in the air.

Careful.  The water.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry peers into the lake.  It is black as ink.

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Harry follows Dumbledore around the rim of the lake.  In 
the center, a GREENISH GLOW shimmers in the mist.

DUMBLEDORE

It’s there.  The only question is 
how do we get to it?

HARRY

We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a 
Summoning Charm, sir?

Dumbledore smiles, motions:  Be my guest.  Harry lifts 
his wand.

Accio Horcrux!

HARRY

There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of 
the water.  Harry nearly sheds his skin.  Dumbledore 
calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface.

Perhaps not.

DUMBLEDORE

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Dumbledore leads Harry on.  Stops.  Takes a step back.  
He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry’s horror walks right to 
the lake’s edge.  As the dark water laps over the toes of 
his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the 
air, then closes it... as if gripping something 
invisible.  Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a 
TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin 
air, extending from the water to Dumbledore’s hand.

If you would, Harry...

DUMBLEDORE

Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he 
and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a 
SMALL BOAT pierces the surface, green with algae.

In eerie silence, the boat cleaves the water, ferrying 
Harry and Dumbledore toward the GREENISH GLOW.

HARRY

Sir... have you ever taken Felix 
Felicis?

DUMBLEDORE

Only recreationally.  You see, I 
believe one creates one’s own 
luck.

Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by 
beneath the surface.

HARRY

Professor... there are bodies in 
this lake.

Yes.

DUMBLEDORE

NEW ANGLE (SMALL ISLAND) - MOMENTS LATER

Here the GREENISH GLOW is ferocious.  As the boat 
arrives, Dumbledore steps out.

Remember... the water.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at 
the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a 
PHOSPHORESCENT LIQUID.  Dumbledore extends the tips of 
his blackened fingers toward the basin, but cannot touch 
the liquid.

HARRY

Do you think the Horcrux is in 
there, sir?

Oh yes.

DUMBLEDORE

Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin.  Notes the 
CRYSTAL GOBLET sitting beside it.  Smiles ruefully.

DUMBLEDORE

It has to be drunk.

(as Harry reacts)

You remember the condition on 
which I brought you with me?

Harry starts to respond.  Stops.  Nods.

123

DUMBLEDORE

This potion might paralyze me.  It 
might cause me to forget why I’m 
here.  It might create so much 
pain I beg for relief.  You are 
not to indulge these requests, 
Harry.  It is your job to make 
sure I keep drinking this potion 
even if you have to force it down 
my throat.  Understood?

Why can’t I drink it, sir?

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Because I am much older, much 
cleverer... and much less 
valuable.

(taking the goblet)
Your good health, Harry.

Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and 
brings it to his lips.  Drinks deep.  Closes his eyes.

Professor?

HARRY

Dumbledore shakes his head, silencing Harry, then dips 
the goblet once more.  Twice more he drinks.  His hand 
TREMBLES and he grips the side of the basin.

Professor?  Can you hear me?

HARRY

Dumbledore says nothing.  The corners of his eyes TWITCH.  
His hand TREMBLES, savagely this time, and he nearly 
drops the goblet.  Harry reaches out, steadies his hand.

DUMBLEDORE
Don’t... don’t make me...

Harry eyes Dumbledore’s anguished face, steels himself.

HARRY

You... you can’t stop, Professor.  
You’ve got to keep drinking.  Like 
you said.  Remember.

Harry staggers back, so primal is Dumbledore’s plea.  
Dumbledore’s arm goes slack, the goblet clanging dully 
against the side of the basin.  Harry takes a breath, 
steps forward, places his hand over Dumbledore’s, lifts 
the cup.

123

DUMBLEDORE

Make it stop... Please... make it 
stop...

HARRY

It will, sir.  It’ll stop.  But 
only if you drink...

Harry, his own hand TREMBLING now, tips the goblet over 
Dumbledore’s lips.

My fault.  It’s all my fault...

DUMBLEDORE

Harry brings the goblet up once more.  Dumbledore drinks.

DUMBLEDORE

Too much... I can’t... take it... 
I want... to die... kill... kill 
me... KILL ME, HARRY!

What?

HARRY

Your word, Harry!  Your word!

DUMBLEDORE

No...

HARRY

KILL ME!  IT’S THE ONLY WAY!

DUMBLEDORE

Harry stands paralyzed, unsure what to do.  Then... 
Dumbledore collapses, rolls onto his back.  Harry pelts 
forward, dips the goblet into the basin and kneels by 
Dumbledore.

HARRY

One more.  Just one more.  And 
then -- I promise... I’ll do what 
you say.

Dumbledore, jaw clinched shut, eyes Harry.

Dumbledore’s jaw relaxes and Harry pries open his mouth, 
tips the liquid down his throat.  Pain ripples through 
Dumbledore’s face.  He tries to speak, Harry eyeing him 
with trepidation, fearful of what he will request.  Again 
and again Dumbledore struggles and then... his eyes... 
open.  Find Harry.

123

Water.

DUMBLEDORE

A shudder of relief goes through Harry.  Grinning, he 
leaps to the basin.  A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the 
bottom.  Harry snatches it up.

Water...

Aguamenti.

DUMBLEDORE

HARRY

Instantly COLD CLEAR WATER rises in the basin.

You did it, sir.  Look --

HARRY

Harry frowns.  The goblet is empty.

Water!

DUMBLEDORE

Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it 
to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty.  
Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his 
tongue like SAND.  He GULPS DRILY for air.

I’m trying, sir.  I’m --

HARRY

Harry stops.  All is silent... except for the SOFT 
LAPPING of the lake.  He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES 
gliding just below the surface.  Deciding, he dips the 
goblet into the dark water.  Instantly, the lake begins 
to CHURN.  Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his 
hand.  FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling 
water.

Harry tips the water into Dumbledore’s mouth.  Dumbledore 
blinks.  His tongue probes his lower lip.  Harry returns 
to the water’s edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet 
into water once more.  Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND 
snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under.  The goblet 
bobs on the surface.

Utterly silent.  Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for 
him, turning him this way and that.  HAUNTED FACES float 
by.

NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE

Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking, 
catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the 
basin as he is...

NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER

... pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE 
of flailing arms.  He shakes free again and again, but 
there are too many hands, too many haunted faces.  We 
STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning.  His 
eyes lose their focus, turning blank.  Bubbles trail out 
of his mouth as his face goes slack.  He sinks deeper, in 
free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE 
ABOVE, the last thing he will see... when a SHADOW 
SHIVERS briefly and...

... the SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then 
becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed 
directly at the water.

NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE

Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING FOR 
AIR.  Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the 
basin, weakened by his effort.  Harry scrambles up, 
steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE.  Harry 
wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain.

Go...

DUMBLEDORE

Harry turns, confused.  Dumbledore’s hand finds his face.

We have to... go.

DUMBLEDORE

Harry glances to the boat.  Flames lick the prow, 
darkening the wood, but do not destroy it.  He nods.

Harry and Dumbledore emerge from the cave.  Dumbledore, 
pale and weak, scans the stars wearily, leans heavily on 
Harry.

A CHOIR IN FULL VOICE RISES ON THE AIR and we --

INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT

CUT TO:

We HOLD ON the Gothic glass of the main window.  Ambient 
light, ominous and cool, plays across its shimmering 
surface.  Flitwick, arms flowing gracefully, conducts a 
group of FIFTH YEARS, looks up toward the window, eyes 
the pulsating light.

126

EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT

126

McGonagall stands in the courtyard as the CHOIR DRIFTS 
FAINTLY on the night air.  She glances up to the sky, a 
curious expression on her face, then spies a pair of 
First Years straggling across the courtyard.

To your Houses.  No dawdling.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

As they scuttle off, McGonagall looks back to the sky.  A 
VORTEX of CLOUDS swirls eerily in on itself.  We PULL 
BACK...

Draco’s face, skin glimmering with the light crawling 
across the ceiling above him.  He stares, unblinking, 
swings out of the bed.  Bare feet -- Draco’s -- drop to 
the tiles.

130

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

The choir echoes eerily.  SIXTH YEARS, little more than 
SHADOWS, hang out, giggling in dark corners.  Malfoy 
glides by in his bare feet.  Unnoticed.  A ghost.

INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

Dense with shadow.  Strange slashes of light.  Malfoy, a 
shadow within shadows, pulls the tapestry from the 
Vanishing Cabinet, steps back...

He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and 
begins to CHANT eerily.  The surface of the cabinet 
glimmers, atremble in the ambient light.  Almost alive.  
Then he stops.  Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips 
away.

Light plays within the cabinet.  Movement.  Shadows 
flicker within, coalesce.  We ease up, reveal...

Bellatrix.  Greyback.  And a few friends.  Bellatrix 
steps into the light.  Glances around.  Grins.

door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING 
WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.

HARRY

Sir, are you... praying?
DUMBLEDORE

(smiling faintly)

No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was 
merely closing a window -- the one 
that had allowed us to Apparate.

Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS 
sound.  Draws his wand.  Dumbledore cocks his head, 
listening.  Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his 
infirmity.

DUMBLEDORE

Hide yourself below.  And do not 
speak or show yourself without my 
permission.  No matter what.

Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to 
the tier below.  The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER.

Do as I say, Harry.

Harry hesitates.  Dumbledore’s eyes blaze...

Trust me.

Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and 
slips down the stairs.  As he reaches the level below, 
the DOOR above FLIES OPEN.  Harry peers up through the 
grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW.

I often talk aloud to myself.  I 
find it extraordinarily useful.  
That which sounds sane at a 
whisper can seem utterly mad when 
said for all the world to hear.  
Haven’t been whispering to 
yourself, have you, Draco?

Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease.

You are not an assassin, Draco.

DUMBLEDORE

MALFOY

How do you know what I am?  I’ve 
done things that would shock you.

DUMBLEDORE

Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping 
she would, in turn, bear a cursed 
necklace to me?  Like replacing a 
bottle of mead with one laced with 
poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but 
these are attempts so feeble I 
cannot help but question if your 
heart has been really in them.  
I’m curious.  When Voldemort gave 
you this task, when he asked you 
to kill me, was it in a whisper?

He trusts me!  I was chosen!

MALFOY

Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls back his sleeve and 
reveals the DARK MARK.  Dumbledore barely looks at it.

Then I shall make it easy for you.

DUMBLEDORE

Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand.   
Instantly Malfoy raises his own.

Expelliarumus!

MALFOY

Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore’s wand flies free, 
clattering across the grid above.  Malfoy watches it roll 
to a stop, a curious mixture of fear and awe at his own 
actions.  Dumbledore eyes the wand, then Draco.

Malfoy’s wand rises once again.  Harry raises his own, 
aiming through the grid, poised.  Just then, a SHADOW 
splinters through the columns to his right.  He looks, 
finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.  
Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a 
finger to his lips:  Shhh.  Then he is drifting upward.  
Silent.  A ghost again.

A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the 
chest.  For a second he hangs, suspended upon the 
ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.

HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE.  Bellatrix raises her wand to the 
sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking 
Harry’s cry.  The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT, 
mutating into a SKULL.  As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s 
arm drops limply to his side.

You can no longer stay here.

Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where 
Dumbledore stood only seconds before.  Snape takes him by 
the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then 
follows.

Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the 
ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above.  He peers

solemn as a church.  Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY 
BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite.  As it EXPLODES, a 
BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE 
CANDLES.  Snape turns, looks back.  Bellatrix simply 
GRINS, a mad child.

132D

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132D

As Bellatrix’s BLAST ECHOES, Ron and Hermione -- racing 
side by side in their regular clothes -- glance at one 
another, dash on. 

132E

EXT. CASTLE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132E

Filch, on guard, looks up, watches SHARDS OF GLASS spill 
from the window like jewels, standing transfixed as the 
fragments lash his face, draw blood.

132F

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132F

Harry races on, glances out a window and sees Snape and 
the others racing across a lower courtyard.

132G

EXT. LOWER COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132G

Malfoy slows, glancing upward, watching the students come 
to the windows and peer out at the emerald sky.  They 
look like ghosts in their nightclothes.

BELLATRIX

Draco!  Draco!
They’ll kill you if you stay.

(as he turns)

132H

INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132H

Hermione and Ron push through the other students, who are 
confused, crying.  McGonagall appears, meets Ron and 
Hermione’s glance, continues on.

EXT. HAGRID’S HUT/GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 

132I

Quiet here.  A VIEW TOWARD the castle.  We HOLD.  Slowly 
FIGURES appear on the horizon.  The Death Eaters.  
Greyback.  Bellatrix, Draco.  And Snape.

133

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT

133

Harry bursts through the entrance doors, wand in hand.  
Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW.  
He sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrid’s Hut.

134

EXT. HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT

134

Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds.  
Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back.  Sees Harry 
sprinting toward him.  Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching 
Harry too.

Go on!

SNAPE

HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       135.

CONTINUED:
Just then a GIANT FIREBALL erupts into the sky.  Snape 
wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against 
the flames.  They’ve set Hagrid’s Hut ablaze.  Malfoy 
stands paralyzed.

134

Go on!

SNAPE

NEW ANGLE - HARRY

Running.  Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in 
his eyes.  Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and 
black against the raging fire.  Harry points his wand, 
fires a JET of RED LIGHT.  Snape doesn’t move, merely 
lets it streak by his head.  Harry stops, chest heaving, 
and takes aim again.

Cruciatus!

HARRY

Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.

Incacerata!

HARRY

Once again, Snape deflects the spell.

Impedimenta!

HARRY

Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.  
Harry drops his arm in frustration.

Fight!  Fight back, you coward!

HARRY

With staggering quickness, Snape’s wand whips forth and 
Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.

SNAPE

Don’t ever associate that word and 
my name again.

Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand 
when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into 
the grass.  Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.

No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!

SNAPE

Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.  
Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.  
Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one 
last time.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

134

Sectumsempra!

HARRY

Bang!  Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto 
his back.  Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over 
him, when Snape comes INTO VIEW.

SNAPE

You dare use my own spells against 
me, Potter?

Harry goes still.  His eyes shift, meet Snape’s.

SNAPE

You may have gotten your mother’s 
eyes, but you’re as dim as your 
father.  Yes.  It’s me.  I’m the 
Half-Blood Prince.

Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining 
Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming 
ruins of Hagrid’s Hut.  They head for the darkness of the 
treeline.  And VANISH.  Harry pounds his fist into the 
ground, then stops.

Hagrid... HAGRID!

HARRY

Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its 
hinges.  Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard 
SMOKING.

Hagrid!  You alright?

HARRY

HAGRID

Take more’n tha’ ter finish me 
off.  Not sure about me ‘ouse, 
tho’.  But if anybody can put it 
righ’, Dumbledore can.

Hagrid, Dumbledore --

HARRY

HAGRID

Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’ 
Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot.

Hagrid turns then, sees the HUGE THRONG of STUDENTS and 
STAFF assembled outside the castle.  

(CONTINUED)

134

HAGRID

An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’?  
Who’s been killed?

(stopping)

Where’s Dumbledore, ‘arry?  
Where’s Dumbledore!!

Harry tries to speak, but he is mute.  Hagrid goes still.

135

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MIDDLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

135

Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff.  They turn 
and watch the throng of students part for Harry and 
Hagrid.

Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees.  Harry 
pushes on, kneels.  Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his 
face peaceful.  Harry straightens his half-moon 
spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.  
Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered 
cheek.

Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen 
hand:  the locket.  He takes it, considers it numbly.  
Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his 
body.  Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps 
forward, drops beside him.  At her touch, his head falls 
on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him.  Ron looks 
on.  Understands all.

McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly 
the TIP GLOWS to life.  One after another, students and 
staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute.  As 
CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING 
FIRE.  The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more.  
The Dark Mark vanishes.

136

EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY

The castle sits silent.  BLACK BANNERS fly on the 
parapets.

136A

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Silent.  Desolate.

A tapestry tosses lightly in the breeze. The PERCH in 
the empty birdcage sways, SQUEAKING gently.

139

INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - DAY

139

Quiet.  Still.  Empty.  Then:

The door eases OPEN and Harry enters.  For a moment, he 
simply stands staring.  Taking inventory.  Spying 
something, he crosses to the great desk opposite.  Looks 
down.

Dumbledore’s wand.

Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand.  Old, oft-used and 
bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a 
strangely beautiful object.  Harry traces his thumb 
lightly over the wood, transfixed, when...

... McGonagall enters.

Potter.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand.  McGonagall’s eyes 
drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face.  She 
frowns, trying to call forth some words.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Potter, in light of what’s 
happened... should you feel the 
need to talk to someone...

She falters.  Harry gently sets the wand back upon the 
desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last 
look.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

You should know... Professor 
Dumbledore...

Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words 
necessary.  At a loss, she finishes quietly:

You meant a great deal to him.

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Harry’s eyes rise.  High upon the wall, the past 
Headmasters snooze in their frames.  The last looks 
remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as 
he sleeps.

Dumbledore.

Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits.

INT. TOWER DORMITORY - DAY

140

Harry stands at the window, alone in the empty dormitory.  
At the doorway, he looks back.  As if committing it to 
memory.

141

INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry starts down the stairs, stops.  Hermione, Ron and 
Ginny sit talking quietly.  Ginny looks up.  Smiles 
softly.

142

EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DAY

Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and 
Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot.  Harry 
stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid’s Hut.  
Hermione toys with the locket before them.

141

142

HERMIONE

Do you think he would’ve done it.  
Draco?

HARRY

No.  He was lowering his wand.  In 
the end, it was Snape.  It was 
always Snape.  And I did 
nothing...

Hermione studies Harry, takes the locket from the 
rampart.

HERMIONE

Strange.  Thinking this is a piece 
of Voldemort’s soul...

HARRY

Yeah, strange.  Only... it’s not.  
It’s a fake.

As Hermione reacts, Harry nods.

Go on.  Open it.

CONTINUED:
Hermione pries open the locket and removes a piece of 
PARCHMENT folded in a tight square.  READS:

142

HERMIONE

‘To the Dark Lord.  I know I will 
be dead long before you read this 
but I want you to know that it was 
I who discovered your secret.  I 
have stolen the real Horcrux and 
intend to destroy it as soon as I 
can.  I face death in the hope 
that when you meet your match, you 
will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.’
R.A.B.?

(looking up)

HARRY

Dunno.  But whoever they are, they 
have the real Horcrux.  Which 
means, it was a waste.  All of it.

Hermione studies Harry’s troubled face, then glances at 
Ginny and Ron.

HERMIONE

Ron’s okay with it, you know.  You 
and Ginny.  But if I were you, 
when he’s around, I’d keep the 
snogging to a minimum.

Hermione smiles faintly, trying to cheer him, but Harry 
merely nods, looks away again.

I’m not coming back, Hermione.

HARRY

Hermione nods.

We reckoned -- Ron and me.  

HERMIONE

HARRY

I have to finish what Dumbledore 
started. I’m not sure where that 
will lead me... but I’ll let you 
and Ron konw where I am -- when I 
can.  (ALT:  I have to finish what 
Dumbledore started.  And... I have 
to do it alone.)

HERMIONE

I’ve always admired your courage, 
Harry, but sometimes... you’re 
really thick.

Harry turns, looking at her in surprise.

142

HERMIONE

You don’t honestly think you can 
find all those Horcruxes by 
yourself, do you?

(leaning in; a 
whisper)

You need us, Harry.

Harry just stares at her.  She cocks her head, smiling, 
doing her best to coax one out of him.  Finally, he does, 
briefly. 

HARRY

Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor.  
When I’m around?  Keep the 
snogging to a minimum.

Hermione looks stunned.  Reddens.

Like that’s going to happen.

HERMIONE

She glances at Ron, shakes her head.

HERMIONE
Besides, he’s barking.

Funny, he says the same about you.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Yes, but I’m exceptionally 
perceptive.

You’re brilliant.  You both are.

HARRY

Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze.  She 
looks out over the grounds.  Slowly losing herself.  We 
can tell.  She’s taking inventory.  Pressing it into a 
scrapbook.

HERMIONE

Do you think we’ll ever... (come 
back?)

She stops.  Her eyes glisten briefly.  Then she fights it 
back.  Tough.  Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches 
over and gives her hand a brief squeeze.  Then releases 
her.

I don’t know.

HARRY

Hermione nods and Harry’s eyes shift, consider Ron and 
Ginny.  As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they 
exchange a look, something unspoken but true passing 
between them.

Just then a SONG rises on the air, mournful and haunting, 
and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the 
tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the 
sky.

Ron and Ginny cross to Harry and Hermione, lean against 
the rampart.  All look to the horizon, watching the bird 
grow smaller while its song -- magically -- endures.

No one says a word.

FADE OUT.
