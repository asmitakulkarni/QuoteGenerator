FADE IN:

TITLE CARD - WARNER BROS. PRESENTS
We PUSH THROUGH THE LOGO INTO a living, breathing DAILY 
PROPHET.  GRIM HEADLINES SAIL PAST US:  Death.  Paranoia.  
A world at war.  We ZOOM INTO a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH of the 
Minister of Magic, RUFUS SCRIMGEOUR, standing in the...

INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - ATRIUM - DAY

... atrium of the Ministry of Magic, addressing a sea of 
MINISTRY EMPLOYEES as REPORTERS scribble intently.

SCRIMGEOUR

These are dark times, there is no 
denying.  Our world has perhaps 
faced no greater threat than it 
does today.  But I say this to our 
citizenry:  we, ever your 
servants, continue to defend your 
liberty and repel the forces that 
would seek to take it from you.  
Your Ministry remains strong...

CAMERA FAVORS a pair of wizards, YAXLEY and PIUS 
THICKNESSE, who turn away as we PULL OUT of the 
PHOTOGRAPH and SAIL once more THROUGH the turning pages, 
the headlines growing grimmer, the faces more HAUNTED, 
until, finally, we emerge from the Prophet and find it in 
the hands of...

INT. GRANGER HOME - HERMIONE’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
(RAINING)

... HERMIONE.  She stares stoically at a LURID HEADLINE -- 
MUGGLE FAMILY MURDERED -- VIOLENCE SPREADS.

Hermione.  Your tea is ready, 
dear.

MRS. GRANGER (O.S.)

Hermione glances through the doorway to the stairs 
beyond.  Her MOTHER’S SHADOW clings to the wall, 
trembling within another SHADOW, that of a WIND-TOSSED 
TREE.  It is strangely beautiful and Hermione seems 
transfixed...

Coming, Mum.

HERMIONE

Her mother’s SHADOW withdraws, leaving only the trembling 
tree.  Hermione glances once more at the Prophet’s 
troubling headline, then slips it into a TINY BEADED BAG.

INT. PARLOR - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER, RAINING)

As Hermione descends the stairs, MRS. GRANGER exits the 
kitchen with a teapot.

MRS. GRANGER

Don’t you look lovely.  All 
packed?

Hermione nods and watches her mother set the teapot on 
the table in front of the television.  Just then, MR. 
GRANGER steps out holding a biscuit tin.

MR. GRANGER

Are you sure these biscuits are 
sugar-free?

MRS. GRANGER

Quite sure, dear.  See the big 
bold letters that say ‘Sugar 
Free’?  Dead giveaway.

MR. GRANGER

Mm.  Yes.

(passing Hermione)

Hello, kitten.  Don’t you look 
lovely.

Hermione smiles wanly as her father gives her a peck on 
the head, then joins her mother on the sofa opposite the 
television.  An AUSTRALIAN WILDLIFE PROGRAM PLAYS.

TELEVISION (V.O.)

... the bandicoot has small 
pointed ears and a long snout from 
which it emits a distinctive 
trumpet sound when agitated...

MRS. GRANGER

Darling, don’t be suspicious the 
biscuits taste so good, be 
grateful the company’s so 
clever...

Hermione looks away from the screen, studies her mother 
and father.  Slowly, she reaches into the tiny bag and 
withdraws her wand.  Taking two steps forward, she points 
it toward the back of their heads.  Hand trembling, she 
SPEAKS, her VOICE barely a WHISPER:

Obliviate.

HERMIONE

Mrs. Granger’s face goes briefly slack and she reaches 
out, as if to break a fall, then, slowly, her hand drops, 
coming to rest upon her husband’s.  He blinks once, 
blankly, and then... enfolds her fingers in his.  
Hermione lowers her arm and, eyes stinging with tears, 
watches the PHOTOGRAPHS placed about the room begin to 
CHANGE.  One by one, Hermione DISAPPEARS from each.

Goodbye.

HERMIONE

EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER, RAINING)

Clutching the beaded bag, Hermione moves down the 
windswept street into the dying light.  We BOOM UP TO the 
sky, HOLD briefly, then BOOM DOWN TO...

EXT. FRONT YARD (THE BURROW) - DUSK

... RON, staring at the stars.  He drops his gaze to the 
house, studies GINNY and MRS. WEASLEY, aglow in the light 
of the kitchen, watching them with affection, as if 
committing them to memory.  His gaze shifts to the 
adjacent SHED.  Inside, ARTHUR WEASLEY is bent over his 
workbench.

INT. SHED - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

Mr. Weasley fiddles with a SMALL RADIO.  Another half-
dozen -- in various stages of repair -- stand in a line 
before him.

What are those?

RON

Mr. Weasley turns, sees Ron standing in the doorway.

Close the door.

ARTHUR WEASLEY

Ron eases inside and steps to the workbench.  Mr. Weasley 
turns the knob on the radio before him.  STATIC spits 
forth, then a VOICE comes clear:

RADIO (V.O.)

... comes to us this evening from 
the north of England, where a 
wizard family by the name of 
Westinburgh were found dead in 
their cellar.  While not a member 
of the Order, Mr. Westinburgh and 
his wife had, on numerous 
occasions, provided shelter for 
its members...

Arthur switches off the radio.  Gestures to the others.

ARTHUR WEASLEY

These are for the Order.  So many 
are on the run now, it helps them 
to stay connected with the rest of 
us.  Know they’re not alone...

Ron studies his father’s weary face as the older man 
stares at his handiwork.  Places his hand upon his 
shoulder.

C’mon.  Mum’s got dinner ready.

RON

Arthur nods, pushes away from the bench and heads out the 
door.  Ron lingers briefly, studying the radio, then 
follows his father into the night.  We FADE.  The TITLE 
CARD appears... and we --

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NIGHT SKY

A scarlet moon.  A speck -- a nightbird, or a bat -- 
framed in the moon’s surface, approaches rapidly, then -- 
WHOOSH! -- passes beneath.  Far below, a sea of treetops 
shift eerily.

EXT. MALFOY MANOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

We PLUMMET THROUGH the shifting trees TO a narrow moonlit 
lane.  A SHADOW ripples across the ground like a kite 
made of water.  A BOOT touches down upon the graveled 
lane, then another.  A cape flutters slowly down upon the 
shoulders of a wizard, lank hair splayed across his wind-
blown collar.  His head turns.  Moonlight strikes his 
pale face.  SNAPE.

Moving.  Up a wide drive, to a pair of wrought iron 
gates.  Beyond, a large manor that has seen better days.  
A RUSTLING sounds.  Snape wheels, draws his wand.

A PEACOCK, white as a ghost, emerges from the yew.  Snape 
eyes it warily, then lifts his hand.  The iron gates turn 
to smoke.

10

INT. MALFOY MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

10

Fractured in the prism of a diamond-paned window, Snape 
approaches.  The front door glides open.  As he enters, 
dark eyes in torch-lit portraits track him from above.

11

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

A door looms at the end of a hallway.  Reaching it, Snape 
hesitates for a heartbeat, then enters.

12

INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Two dozen figures sit silently at a large ornate table, 
illuminated by the flickering light of a fireplace.  
Snape studies the scene, then his eyes rise.  Revolving 
slowly near the ceiling, as if suspended by an invisible 
rope, is an unconscious WOMAN (CHARITY BURBAGE).

12

VOLDEMORT

Severus.  I was beginning to worry 
you’d lost your way.  Come.  I’ve 
saved you a seat.

VOLDEMORT grins, silhouetted against the fire, and 
gestures to the seat nearest his own.  All eyes follow 
Snape, all except DRACO MALFOY, who nervously stares at 
the body above and a haggard LUCIUS MALFOY, who merely 
stares vaguely at his wand while his wife NARCISSA looks 
straight ahead.

VOLDEMORT

You know our hosts, of course, 
Severus.  Narcissa in particular 
has been most hospitable.  Lucius, 
on the other hand, is, I fear, 
burdened by my presence.  Are you, 
Lucius?

My lord?

LUCIUS

Are you burdened?

VOLDEMORT

My lord is always welcome here.

NARCISSA MALFOY

Voldemort smiles, his eyes shifting to Snape, who watches 
the great snake NAGINI as she slopes slowly over the feet 
of those present, unnerving all.

You bring news I trust, Severus?

VOLDEMORT

SNAPE

It will happen Saturday next.  At 
nightfall.

And this information comes --

VOLDEMORT

-- from the source we discussed.

SNAPE

Yaxley, the wizard seen at the Ministry, leans into the 
flickering light from the opposite end of the table.

YAXLEY

I have heard differently, my lord.  
Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that 
the Potter boy will not be moved 
until the thirtieth of this month, 
the night before he turns 
seventeen.

SNAPE

This is a false trail.  The Auror 
Office no longer plays any part in 
the protection of Harry Potter.  
Those closest to him believe we 
have infiltrated the Ministry.

SQUAT MAN

Well, they’ve got that right, 
then, ‘aven’t they?

As the Squat Man cackles wheezily, others join in.  
Voldemort raises a hand.  All goes silent.

Pius, what say you?

VOLDEMORT

PIUS THICKNESSE looks up, his gaze placid.

THICKNESSE

One hears many things, my lord.  
Whether the truth is among them is 
not clear.

12

VOLDEMORT

Spoken like a true politician.  
You will, I think, prove most 
useful, Pius.  Where will he be 
taken?  The boy?

SNAPE

To a safehouse.  Likely the home 
of someone in the Order.  I’m told 
it has been given every manner of 
protection possible. Once there, 
it will be impractical to attack 
him.  We may have compromised the 
Ministry, but there are those who 
remain loyal to him.  As long as 
the Ministry stands, his allies 
within will have the means at 
their disposal to insure his 
safety.

BELLATRIX

My lord, if I might, I’d like to 
volunteer myself for this task.  
I’d like to kill the boy.

Just then a WAIL rises from the floorboards.  Voldemort’s 
eyes flash briefly with RED.

VOLDEMORT

Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to 
you about keeping our guest quiet?

WORMTAIL

Yes, m-my lord.  Right away, my 
lord.

As WORMTAIL scrambles up, Voldemort returns his gaze to 
BELLATRIX.

VOLDEMORT

As inspiring as I find your 
bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be 
the one to kill Harry Potter.  But 
I face an unfortunate 
complication.  It has recently 
come to my attention that my wand 
and Potter’s share the same core.  
They are, in some ways, twins.  We 
can wound but not fatally harm one 
another.  Which means, if I am to 
kill him... I will have to do it 
with another’s wand.

The others at the table stir nervously.  Bellatrix 
stiffens.  Voldemort’s narrow eyes rake the room.

you, Lucius?

Lucius peers up, sallow and beaten.

12

I require your wand.

VOLDEMORT

Lucius sits mute, paralyzed by the request, scanning the 
faces of the others, who avoid his gaze, all but Snape, 
who regards him with naked contempt and Draco, whose eyes 
meet his briefly, then glance away.  Finally Narcissa’s 
fingers lightly graze his wrist, summoning him back to 
the moment.  Turning, he watches as, almost 
imperceptibly, she nods.  Lowering his head, he ROLLS his 
wand slowly across the table, where it stops at 
Voldemort’s skeletal hand.  Voldemort holds the wand to 
the light.

Do I detect elm?

VOLDEMORT

Yes, my lord.

And the core?

LUCIUS

VOLDEMORT

Dragon -- dragon heartstring.

LUCIUS

Voldemort nods, getting a feel for the wand’s heft, then 
his eyes shift, catch Lucius staring at the WAND on the 
table -- Voldemort’s own.

VOLDEMORT

My wand?  You can’t possibly think 
I would give you my wand.

Lucius’ eyes meet Voldemort’s.  For a moment he is 
speechless.  Finally his chin drops.

No, my lord.

LUCIUS

Voldemort studies Lucius’ bowed head, then returns his 
attention to the wand in his hand.  Raising it, he points 
it at the body above.  With a FLICK, the body awakens, 
TWITCHING against its invisible bonds.

VOLDEMORT

For those of you who do not know, 
we are joined tonight by Miss 
Charity Burbage who until recently 
taught at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her 
specialty was Muggle studies. It 
is Miss Burbage’s belief that 
Muggles are not so different from 
us.

VOLDEMORT (CONT'D)

She would, given her way, have us 
mate with them.  To her, the 
mixture of magical and Muggle 
blood is not an abomination but 
something to be encouraged.  I, of 
course, take a contrary view.  But 
we’re all civilized here.  All 
adults.  We can agree to disagree.

Charity’s tear-streaked face revolves once more to face 
Snape, her voice hoarse with fear.

Severus, please.  We’re friends...

CHARITY

Snape’s face remains impassive.  Voldemort’s eyes narrow 
to scarlet slits... his voice HISSES.  Draco watches a 
teardrop strike the table...

Avada Kedavra!

EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK

A blood-red sky hangs over the neighborhood.

14

INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - HARRY’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - DUSK

14

An EYE shimmers in a SHARD of SILVERED GLASS.  HARRY 
POTTER’S eye.  He tosses the mirror inside a LUMPY 
RUCKSACK, than adds a LOCKET, a Daily Prophet CLIPPING 
entitled “Dumbledore Remembered” (above which is a 
PHOTOGRAPH of its author, ELPHIAS DOGE with DUMBLEDORE) 
and a NOTEBOOK filled with scribblings on Horcruxes and, 
in large block letters, the initials “R.A.B.”  He gives 
the rucksack a shake, then glances about to see if he’s 
forgotten anything.  The room looks as if it’s been 
bottled up and shaken.  Dresser drawers turned out, floor 
covered in detritus.

Come now, Dudley.  Hurry up!

UNCLE VERNON (O.S.)

Harry steps to the window, peers to the driveway below.  
UNCLE VERNON rolls a large STEAMER TRUNK towards his car, 
followed by DUDLEY, who tugs an equally large TRUNK of 
his own.  Harry speaks to HEDWIG.

Time for the teary farewell.

HARRY

15

INT. STAIRWELL/FRONT HALLWAY - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

15

Harry drops down the stairs.  The house feels barren, 
desolate.  Aunt Petunia stands at the mouth of the 
kitchen, looking around.  Seeing her, Harry comes to a 
stop.

AUNT PETUNIA

I’ve lived in this house twenty 
years.  And now -- in a single 
night -- I’m expected to leave.

HARRY

They’ll torture you.  Even Dudley.  
If they think you know where I’m 
going, they’ll stop at noth--

AUNT PETUNIA

You think I don’t know that?  You

capable of?

Her eyes pierce Harry’s.

AUNT PETUNIA

You didn’t just lose a mother that 
night in Godric’s Hollow, you 
know.  I lost a sister.

Harry studies her, taken aback.

Do you have any?  Magic?

HARRY

AUNT PETUNIA
What a cruel thing to ask.

16

EXT. PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER)

16

Uncle Vernon tests the strap binding the trunks to a 
small TRAILER hitched to the back of the Dursley car, 
then squints awkwardly at Harry.

Well, this is goodbye then, boy.

UNCLE VERNON

Harry, standing by the front door, nods, eyes Petunia, 
who sits in the front passenger seat, a ghost behind the 
glass.

DUDLEY

I don’t understand.  Isn’t he 
coming with us?

Who?

Harry.

UNCLE VERNON

DUDLEY

Absolutely not.

UNCLE VERNON

Why?

DUDLEY

UNCLE VERNON

Well, because -- he doesn’t want 
to, do you, boy?

HARRY

Absolutely not.  Besides, I’m just 
a waste of space.  Isn’t that 
right, Vernon?

Uncle Vernon stares hard at Harry.

UNCLE VERNON
Come on, Dudley, we’re off.

Uncle Vernon starts for the car.  Dudley hesitates, then 
crosses the lawn to Harry, extends his hand.

DUDLEY

I don’t think you’re a waste of 
space.

Well... thanks.

HARRY

Harry grips Dudley’s hand, then watches his cousin turn 
and lope back across the lawn.

HARRY

(under his breath)

See you, Big D.

17

INT. DURSLEY HOUSE - BOTTOM FLOOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

17

Harry stands, rucksack over his shoulder, Hedwig’s cage 
in hand.  Somewhere, nearby, a CLOCK TICKS.  Otherwise, 
all is still.  Utterly quiet.  He glances about the 
house, full of shadows, like ghosts.  His eyes burn with 
bitterness.

Good riddance.

HARRY

His eyes shift.  The last rays of sunlight lay, like a 
stain, upon a SMALL CUPBOARD DOOR below the stairs.  He 
lets the rucksack slip from his shoulder.  Sets down the 
cage.

18

INT. CUPBOARD UNDERNEATH THE STAIRS - SAME TIME - NIGHT

18

The door opens.  Harry’s face appears.  Motes of dust 
dance before his eyes.  He peers into the shadows, into 
his past.  A DEAD SPIDER hangs within an ancient web.  A 
REGIMENT of TOY SOLDIERS  -- broken and draped with dust  
-- line a listing shelf.  As the SUN withdraws from the 
hallway, a tremor passes through Harry’s face and then...

A TREMENDOUS ROAR murders the silence, the roar of a 
MOTOR BIKE.  Harry straightens -- half-believing he’s 
dreamed it into existence -- and STRIKES his head on the 
low door frame.

19

INT. HALLWAY/KITCHEN - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Harry pelts down the dark hall as OPAQUE SHAPES race past 
the windows.  He trips past Hedwig’s cage, sending it 
WOBBLING and flings open the front door.

20

EXT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

HERMIONE flings her arms around Harry.  RON gives him a 
clap on the back.  Others emerge from the shadows:  FRED, 
GEORGE, BILL, FLEUR, TONKS, LUPIN, ARTHUR WEASLEY, MAD-
EYE MOODY, KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT and a small, dirty, 
hangdog man, MUNDUNGUS FLETCHER.  Lastly, HAGRID 
dismounts a MOTORBIKE, strips a pair of fly-specked 
goggles from his face and yanks a SMALL TWITTERING BIRD 
from his beard.

Everyone spills down the hallway into the sitting room.

HARRY

I thought you were looking after 
the Prime Minister, Kingsley.

You’re more important.

SHACKLEBOLT

Harry grins, then a tall, red-headed man (BILL WEASLEY) 
is before him, hand extended.  His face is horribly 
SCARRED.

Hello, Harry.  Bill Weasley.

BILL

Wasn’t always this handsome.

Hope to repay the favor one day.

FLEUR

You are still beautiful to me, 
William.

LUPIN

Just remember, Fleur, once you’re 
married:  Bill takes his steaks on 
the raw side now.

TONKS

My husband, the joker.  By the 
way, wait until you hear the news!  
Remus and I are --

MAD-EYE

All right, all right!  You’ll all 
have time for a cozy catch-up 
later!  We’ve got to get the hell 
out of here and soon!

Moody drops some SACKS at his feet.  Turns to Harry.

MAD-EYE

Potter, you’re underage, which 
means you’ve still got the Trace 
on you.

The Trace?

HARRY

MAD-EYE

You sneeze and the Ministry will 
know who wipes your nose.  Point 
is, we have to use those means of 
transport the Trace can’t detect:  
brooms, thestrals and the like.  
We’ll go in pairs.  That way if 
anyone’s out there waiting for us  
-- and I reckon there will be -- 
they won’t know which Harry Potter 
is the real one.

The real one...?

I told you he’d take it well.

HARRY

If you think I’m going to let 
people risk their lives for me --

Never done that before, have we?

RON

HARRY
This is different.  Taking that.  
Becoming me -- no.
FRED

Well, none of us really fancy it, 
mate.

GEORGE

Yeah, imagine if something went 
wrong and we were stuck as 
scrawny, specky gits forever.

MAD-EYE

Everyone here’s of age, Potter, 
and they’ve all agreed to take the 
risk.

MUNDUNGUS

Technically, I’ve been coerced.

(turning to Harry and 
extending his hand)

Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.  
I’ve always been a huge admirer.

MAD-EYE

Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, 
Granger, as discussed.

Hermione grabs a tuft of Harry’s hair -- yanks.

Blimey, Hermione!

Moody holds out the flask, un-stoppered now.  The potion 
inside begins to spit forth smoke.  He hands it to 
George.

MAD-EYE

For those of you who haven’t taken 
Polyjuice Potion before, fair 
warning.  It tastes like goblin 
piss.

FRED

Have a lot of experience with 
that, do you, Mad-Eye?

Moody’s eye rotates menacingly onto Fred.

Just trying to defuse the tension.

FRED

Fred takes the flask from George, followed by Ron, 
Hermione, Fleur and a less than overjoyed Mundungus. He 
scowls as the potion trickles past his lips and seconds 
later, his features -- like those of the others -- begin 
to bubble like hot wax.  As the transformation completes, 
seven Harry Potters stand in the tiny kitchen.

Wow -- we’re identical!

FRED/GEORGE

Not yet you aren’t.

MAD-EYE

Moody pulls the ties on the SACKS and pulls out SEVEN 
IDENTICAL OUTFITS.

GEORGE

Don’t have something a bit more 
sporty, do you?

FRED

Yes, don’t fancy this color at 
all.

MAD-EYE

Fancy this:  You’re not you, so 
shut it and strip.

(to Harry)

You’ll need to change too, Potter.

Harry, a bit self-consciously, begins to strip down. The 
others, meanwhile, appear unconcerned to be exposing 
Harry’s body.

Bill, look away -- I’m ‘ideous.

HERMIONE
(wobbling a bit)

Harry, your eyesight really is 
awful.

Blimey.  I almost forgot.

MAD-EYE

Mad-Eye rummages in his pocket, pulls out a fistful of 
EYE-GLASSES.

MAD-EYE

Right then.  We’ll be pairing off.  
Each Potter will have a protector.  
As for you, Harry...

Yes?

ALL

The real Harry!  Where the devil 
are you, anyway?

MAD-EYE

Here.

HARRY

Moody’s eye rotates onto the real Harry.

You’ll ride with Hagrid.

MAD-EYE

HAGRID

Brought yeh here sixteen years ago
when you were barely bigger than a 
Bowtruckle. Seems only righ’ I 
should be the one ter take yeh 
away.

MAD-EYE

Yeah, it’s all very touching.  
Let’s go.

As they file out, grabs his rucksack and ponders Hedwig 
in her cage.  He snaps open the wire door and she 
flutters out, swoops down the hallway and soars out the 
open door.  Harry glances once more down the hall, at the 
cupboard under the stairs, then exits.  He HOLD ON 
Hedwig’s empty cage.

The other six Harrys sit upon thestrals and brooms.  
Hagrid sits astride a motorbike, goggles on.

Harry drops in.

MAD-EYE

Good luck, everyone.  On the count

Hagrid kicks the motorbike to life, lurches forward.  
Hedwig swoops upward and beats toward the greasy moon.

As Hagrid roars into the sky, Harry twists round, 
watching one Harry Potter after another whip past, 
watching Privet Drive grow smaller, his eyes stinging in 
the wind, briefly lost in the moment, when...

23

EXT. SKY - SAME TIME - NIGHT

23

... a DISTURBANCE FILLS THE AIR.  Harry turns away, looks 
up.  DEATH EATERS drop from the clouds, surround the 
others.  FLASHES of GREEN LIGHT splinter the darkness.  
Sparks explode on the bike’s chassis and Hagrid HOWLS in 
fury.

HARRY

Hagrid!  We’ve got to help the 
others!

HAGRID

Can’t do it, ‘arry.  My job’s ter 
get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n 
sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders!

Before Harry can reply, FOUR DEATH EATERS jet out of the 
darkness, robes snapping in the wind.  As one, their 
wands rise.  Hagrid slams his hand onto a PURPLE BUTTON.  
With an EAR-SHATTERING BLAST, the motorbike quivers and 
FLAMES BELCH from the exhaust pipe.  The Death Eaters 
SCREAM, robes afire, and pinwheel away, freefalling
towards the earth.

What was that?

Dragon fire!

HARRY

HAGRID

More DEATH EATERS SWOOP from the sky, give chase.  Hagrid 
DIVES, plummeting for the ground, trying desperately to 
shake them.  Harry watches the earth rushing towards 
them, grimacing as the bike...

EXT. MOTORWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

... SLAMS onto the asphalt and slaloms wildly as 
Hagrid...

Sparks skitter off the tunnel and shower down as the 
sidecar rides up into the air repeatedly, then slams down 
onto the roadway.  Harry glances back, sees the Death 
Eaters closing when LIGHT FILLS THE TUNNEL and HAGRID 
ROARS.  Turning back, Harry sees a HUGE LORRY rushing 
towards them.  As the HEADLIGHTS GROW LARGE, Hagrid 
steers the motorbike directly into them -- then past -- 
and up the rounded side of the tunnel.  The motorbike 
loops-the-loop and Harry dangles briefly, watching -- 
upside down -- as two Death Eaters fly smack into the 
lorry -- before the motorbike comes round right side up, 
shoots out...

... MASSIVE ELECTRICAL PYLONS appear in the darkness.  As 
Hagrid weaves through the towers, a gang of Death Eaters 
jet INTO VIEW.  Harry fires a volley of Stunning Spells, 
sending a pair of Death Eaters into the SIZZLING wires 
where they dangle briefly, spasming, before plummeting 
into the darkness.  Harry fires again and watches two 
others take evasive measures... unaware of the Death 
Eater closing in from behind.  Finally he turns.  The 
Death Eater grins, wand twitching, when...

Hedwig swoops down, flaying the Death Eater’s wand hand.

Harry grins triumphantly when... a mad volley of WAND 
BLASTS ricochet off the motorbike and Hedwig is gone.  
Harry glances about desperately, when:

DEATH EATER
That’s him!  The real one!

The remaining Death Eaters fall back and disappear.

HAGRID

Hol’ tight, ‘arry!  We’ve got ter 
get yeh out of here!

Hagrid hits the purple button again and the motorbike 
rockets forth.  Harry gazes bleakly behind... then 
winces, eyes rolling back in his head.  Gripping his 
scar, he squints toward the horizon and sees something 
closing on them.  It looks like smoke, then begins to 
take shape.

Voldemort.  Flying.  Slowly, Harry raises his wand.

HARRY
Hagrid... HAGRID...!

Harry lets out a primal scream, his eyes clenched shut in 
pain, his wand hand trembling as he points it blindly.  
Voldemort’s snake-like face draws near, his wand trained 
on Harry.  Harry’s arm goes slack, his wand dropping...

Avada...

VOLDEMORT

Abruptly, Harry’s arm rises as if on a string, drawn up 
by the wand trembling in his hand.  GOLD FIRE spits forth 
and -- Crack! -- SPARKS skitter up the chassis of the 
motorbike.  Harry wheels and -- for a split second -- is 
face to face with Voldemort, whose eyes drift, staring -- 
with something like fear -- at Harry’s wand.  Then -- 
whoosh! -- Voldemort peels backward and away, evaporating 
like smoke.  Just then...

... the motorbike’s engine HICCUPS and Hagrid and Harry 
begin to drop.  PUTT... PUTT... PUTT...

EXT. THE BURROW - SAME TIME - NIGHT

The motorbike splashes down into the reeds, sputters, 
then cuts out altogether in a SMOKING HISSSSS.  Harry 
glances about.  A door opens in a crooked house.  TWO 
SILHOUETTES appear, dash forward -- MRS. WEASLEY and 
GINNY.

MRS. WEASLEY

Harry!  Hagrid!  What happened?!  
Have you seen the others?

HARRY
Is no one back yet?

He looks from Mrs. Weasley to Ginny.  Ginny shakes her 
head.

HAGRID

They were on us from the star’, 
Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And 
You-Know-Who as well.

Molly Weasley’s face betrays panic, but she fights it 
back.

MRS. WEASLEY

Well, thank goodness you two are

She nods, leads him toward the house.  Once out of 
earshot, Harry turns expectantly to Ginny.  She looks 
frightened.

GINNY

Ron and Tonks should’ve already 
been back.  Dad and Fred as well.

Suddenly, several yards away, a BLUE LIGHT burns in the 
darkness.  Harry and Ginny rush towards it just as Lupin 
materializes, cradling an unconscious “Harry,” clothes 
torn, head awash in BLOOD.  Harry takes in the surreal 
tableau, then watches “himself” transform into George, 
who bears the true damage.  Ginny’s hands fly to her 
face.

GINNY
Oh my God!  George!

LUPIN
The house!  Quickly!

Lupin and Harry drop George onto the sofa, where his head 
rolls into the lamplight, the blood more shocking here.  
Molly Weasley screams.  George’s ear is gone.

MRS. WEASLEY

My boy!  My darling boy!  What’ve 
they done to you?!

Harry looks on miserably -- anger and guilt clashing 
within him -- when Lupin grabs a fistful of his shirt and 
hurls him against the wall.

Remus!  What’re you doing!

I had to make sure you weren’t an 
imposter.

HARRY
Who did this to him?

LUPIN

Snape.

(nodding to George)

He’ll be fine, Molly.  But that’s 
Dark Magic.  The damage is done.

She simply nods, weeping, dabbing at George’s face.  A 
blue glow glimmers against the window, where Hagrid 
stands.

HAGRID
Someone else is back.

Hermione and Kingsley stand together, looking shaken.  As

Lupin.

SHACKLEBOLT

The last words Albus Dumbledore 
spoke to the pair of us?

‘Harry is the best hope we have.  
Trust him.’

Shacklebolt lowers his wand, wheels on Harry.

Fleur, Ron & Tonks.  Ron is still “Harry,” but Hermione 
doesn’t hesitate, enveloping him in a fierce hug.  As he 
transforms back into his own battle-weary self, he looks 
mildly abashed to be in such close proximity to Hermione.

Hey ya -- Well... thanks.

TONKS

Deserves that.  Brilliant, he was.  
Wouldn’t be standing here without 
him.

Arthur Weasley, trailed by the others, stops dead.  Molly

father’s shoulder, eyes stinging with tears as he sees 
his brother.  As if sensing them, George stirs.

How do you feel, Georgie?

FRED

Saint-like.

Come again?

GEORGE

George opens his eyes, lifts a blood-crusted finger, and

Bill doesn’t smile.  Next to him, Fleur looks equally 
grim.

Mad-Eye’s dead.

BILL

The room goes still.

BILL

Mundungus took one look at 
Voldemort and Disapparated.

LUPIN

Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who 
would expect the real Harry to be 
with the most skilled Auror.  He 
knew he’d be in the most danger.

ARTHUR WEASLEY

It doesn’t explain how they knew 
we were moving Harry tonight.

The room grows quiet.  Eyes shift.

HAGRID

Bill and Fleur.  Mum’s been

thing that’s kept her sane, I 
reckon.  She’ll kill me if I miss 
it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face 
to face with You-Know-Who if I’m 
honest.

Ron tries a smile, but Harry looks foul.

HARRY

I don’t care about a bloody 
wedding -- no matter whose it is.  
I have to start searching for the 
Horcruxes.  It’s the only chance 
we have to beat him.  And the 
longer we wait the stronger he 
gets.

Ron just stares at Harry, calm, poised.

RON

Tonight’s not the night, mate.  
You’d only be doing him a favor.

Harry stares at Ron -- incensed by his cool demeanor and 
common sense.  Finally, he turns away, tosses the 
rucksack in frustration.  For a moment they stand like 
this, Harry’s back to Ron.  Silent.  Finally Ron speaks.

Do you think he knows?

RON

Harry turns his head halfway, but doesn’t speak.

RON

I mean, they’re bits of his soul, 
the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When 
Dumbledore destroyed the ring and 
you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary 
all those years ago -- he must’ve
felt something right?

Harry ponders this, but remains silent.

RITA SKEETER grins up at him, holding a BOOK entitled The 
Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.  A bit further down,

Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to 
know what it is we’re doing.  If I 
tell you, I’d be betraying him.

GINNY
Zip me up, will you.

She turns.  The dress is open to the small of her back.  
Harry steps forward and takes the zipper.  As the panels 
close, concealing her skin, his fingers linger at the 
top, lightly brushing the nape of her neck.  They stand 
like this, utterly still, the moment fraught.

GINNY

Seems silly, doesn’t it?  A 
wedding.  Given everything that’s 
going on.

HARRY

Maybe that’s the best reason to 
have it.  Because of everything 
that’s going on.

Her chin turns, coming into profile, her face very close.  
Then she folds into him and they are kissing.  Long.  
Deep.

George wanders in brushing his teeth, pours himself a cup 
of tea and, sticking the toothbrush in his ear-hole, 
leans back against the stove for a sip.  Ginny -- sensing

I think we both know the answer to

Scrimgeour pitches a CLOTH BAG onto the table before 
them.  The trio regard it curiously, exchange glances.

And this would be...?

Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr.

making, in the hope that -- when 
things seem most dark -- it will

Scrimgeour removes a SMALL SILVER OBJECT from the bag.

RON

Dumbledore left this?  For me?  
Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?

Ron CLICKS it and all the light rushes from the lamps 
into the Deluminator, throwing the room into total

a SMALL BOOK, its binding stained and peeling in places.

RON

Mum used to read me those!  The 
Wizard and the Hopping Pot, 
Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling 
Stump...

Harry and Hermione stare blankly at him.

Oh, c’mon!  Beedle’s stories are

‘To Harry James Potter, I leave 
the Snitch he caught in his first 
Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a 
reminder of the rewards of 
perseverance and skill.

Scrimgeour places the tiny golden orb onto Harry’s palm, 
where it glimmers dully.  Harry studies it, then looks 
up.

That’s it then?

HARRY

SCRIMGEOUR

Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a

robes, stands on the periphery, absently FINGERING THE 
SNITCH as Bill and Fleur twirl madly within a clapping 
circle of well-wishers.  Harry’s gaze drifts:  to Ginny, 
laughing as Fred and George rush the dance floor, briefly 
sweep Fleur away from Bill, then begin to dance with each 
other; to Hermione, stunning in black silk:  to Ron, who 
ignores all, his eyes focused entirely on Hermione.

Far across the garden, Hagrid wends through the tables in 
his horrible hairy suit and presents a SLICE OF CAKE to a 
pleased OLYMPE MAXIME.

Nearby, Tonks, hand to her belly, leans forward and 
WHISPERS something to Mrs. Weasley, who reacts with happy 
surprise.  Harry studies Tonks’ belly...

We want you to be the godfather.

LUPIN (O.S.)

Harry turns, sees Lupin standing behind, staring at Tonks 
with affection.  As his eyes shift to Harry, Harry
sputters:

You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- 
I... don’t know what to say.

HARRY

Say yes.

LUPIN

Lupin grins, claps Harry on the shoulder and hikes off 
into the darkness, joining the WIZARDS STANDING GUARD in 
the garden’s deepest shadows.  Harry looks back to Tonks, 
then notices a slight, TUFTY-HAIRED WIZARD (ELPHIAS DOGE) 
sitting alone at a table just beyond her.

Hello, Harry!

LUNA

LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eyed 
wizard (XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD) with shoulder-length white 
hair the texture of candy floss.  Both wear robes the 
color of egg yolk.

LUNA

Oh, I’ve interrupted a deep 
thought, haven’t I?  I can see it 
growing smaller in your eyes.

HARRY

No, ‘course not.  How are you, 
Luna?

LUNA

Very well.  I was bitten by a 
garden gnome only moments ago.

She holds up her finger, which is sheathed in blood.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD

Gnome saliva is enormously 
beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood.  
We live just over the hill!

Nice to meet you, sir.

HARRY

Lovegood suddenly leans close, WHISPERS FIERCELY:

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that 
we at The Quibbler, unlike those 
toadies at the Daily Prophet, 
fully supported Dumbledore during 
his lifetime and in his death 
support you just as fully.

LUNA

Come, Daddy.  Harry doesn’t want 
to talk to us right now.  He’s 
just too nice to say so.

Lovegood’s eyes burn with righteousness, a TRIANGULAR EYE 
dangling from a chain around his neck.  As Luna pulls him 
away, Harry glances once again across the garden.

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER

ELPHIAS DOGE sits alone, smiling absently as he observes 
the happy goings-on.  Then:

Sir?  May I sit down?

HARRY

ELPHIAS DOGE
Mr. Potter!  By all means!

In a nervous flutter, Doge pours Harry a goblet of 
champagne.

HARRY

I found what you wrote in the 
Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I 
take it you knew Professor 
Dumbledore well?

ELPHIAS DOGE

I certainly knew him the longest, 
if you don’t count his brother 
Aberforth -- and somehow, people 
never do seem to count Aberforth.

HARRY

I never even knew he had a 
brother, sir.

ELPHIAS DOGE

Yes, well, Dumbledore was always 
very private.  Even as a boy.

HARRY

Sir, I was wondering if you’d had 
much contact with him before he 
died.

ELPHIAS DOGE

The occasional owl.  Though it was 
strange...

Strange, sir?

HARRY

ELPHIAS DOGE

It was the owls themselves.  They 
often arrived in distress.  It was 
clear they’d traveled great 
distances in some cases.

HARRY

Could you tell me from where 
they’d come, sir?

ELPHIAS DOGE

I’m afraid not.  Albus’ messages 
mostly referenced our days 
together as schoolboys.  They were 
surprisingly intimate.  When he 
did speak of his current 
activities his words would turn 
elliptical.  Still, I sensed he 
was under great stress.  Why do 
you ask?

HARRY

Just curious.  I was... close to 
Professor Dumbledore.

ELPHIAS DOGE

Well, he treasured you, Mr. 
Potter, I can attest to that.  I 
can also tell you that when a 
person passes, it’s only natural 
to rue the things left unsaid, to 
regret the question never asked.  
I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, 
but in many ways he will always 
remain a riddle even to me.

WOMAN (O.S.)

Don’t despair, Elphias.  I’m told 
he’s been thoroughly unriddled by 
Rita Skeeter.  In 800 pages no 
less.

Harry and Doge turn, study the profile of an ANCIENT 
WITCH (MURIEL) sitting at an adjacent table, a glass of 
champagne cradled in the bony fingers of one hand.

ELPHIAS DOGE

That woman is a vulture, Muriel, 
and you well know it.

MURIEL

Someone has to pick the bones to 
get at the truth.  I read your 
obituary, Elphias.  Lovely.  But 
you did skate over some of the 
sticky patches in Dumbledore’s 
life.

ELPHIAS DOGE

I’m sorry you think so, Muriel.  I 
assure you I was writing from the 
heart.

MURIEL

Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn’t 
made that mistake, I’m sure.  Word 
has it someone talked to her, 
someone who knew the Dumbledore 
family well.  You and I both know 
who that is, Elphias.

ELPHIAS DOGE

A monstrous betrayal.  I can only 
conclude the rumors are true and 
that she has become untethered.

Who are you talking about?

HARRY

MURIEL

Well, I don’t suppose it’ll be a 
secret once the book comes out.

(relishing the 
moment)

Bathilda Bagshot.

Who?

HARRY

MURIEL

Who? Bathilda Bagshot!  My god, 
boy, she’s only the most 
celebrated magical historian of 
the last century.  Don’t they read 
History of Magic at Hogwarts 
anymore?

Oh, right.  Slipped my mind...

HARRY

MURIEL

She knew the Dumbledores as well 
as anyone.  She’d have letters, 
perhaps an interesting photograph 
or two.  I’m sure Rita Skeeter 
would have thought it well worth a 
trip to Godric’s Hollow to take a 
peek into that old bird’s rattled 
cage.

HARRY

Godric’s Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot 
lives in Godric’s Hollow?

MURIEL

For years now.  That’s where she 
first met Dumbledore.

HARRY

Excuse me?  You don’t mean to say 
Dumbledore lived there too?

MURIEL

Of course.  The family moved there 
after his father killed those 
three Muggles.  It was quite the 
scandal.

(eyeing him)

Honestly, my boy, are you sure you 
knew him at all?

Harry sits, speechless, then his eye catches a shooting 
star -- or what appears to be.  As it plummets, it grows, 
gaining speed until it slices through the canopy, 
exploding in a burst of light.  All goes SILENT as a 
SILVER LYNX -- graceful and gleaming -- MATERIALIZES amid 
the crowd.  When it speaks, the Patronus has 
Shacklebolt’s sonorous voice.

The Ministry has fallen.  The 
Minister of Magic is dead.  They 
are coming...

PATRONUS

The lynx vanishes.  A SCREAM shreds the silence.  Then:  
chaos.

Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!

ELPHIAS DOGE

Doge extends his hand toward Harry when -- CRACK! -- he 
DISAPPARATES.

Seconds later, the ancient witch has done the same.  
Harry scans the scattering crowd and meets Ginny’s eyes, 
as she gets buffeted about.  He pelts toward her, 
bouncing between bodies, losing sight of her.

Ron!  Ron!

HERMIONE

Harry turns, sees Hermione glancing about frantically.  
As she turns, Ron comes INTO VIEW, pushes toward her.  
Suddenly the canopy above turns to ribbons as DEATH 
EATERS -- in dark cloaks and masks -- descend into the 
crowd.  Arthur, Fred and George wield their wands.  Harry 
sees a flower fall from Fleur’s hair, watches it crushed 
underfoot, then catches sight of Ginny through the 
madness as she draws her own wand, copper hair gleaming, 
eyes flashing.  He starts toward her, when... Lupin 
crashes in, spinning him roughly round.

Harry!  Go!  Go!

LUPIN

A HAND REACHES OUT AND GRABS HIS.  He looks.  It’s 
Hermione, clutching Ron’s hand with her other.  She 
closes her eyes and a great WHOOSHING SOUND fills Harry’s 
ears.  He takes one last desperate look at Ginny as he is 
thrown up and back in a WHIRLWIND and all goes BLACK.  A 
HORN BLARES as...

Ron and Hermione as they stumble INTO VIEW, the streets

RON

HERMIONE

Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to 
come here to the theater with my 
mum and dad.  Just popped into my 
head.  I don’t know why...

They hurry on, glancing over their shoulders at the DARK 
SHAPES that move within the crowd behind them, STRANGERS 
bumping by, FACES passing in a paranoiac BLUR:  a DRUNKEN 
MAN, a CACKLING WOMAN with BLOOD-RED LIPSTICK...

As they take refuge in the shadows, Hermione begins to

We need to change.

Ron and Harry look at each other’s dress robes.  From the 
purse, Hermione extracts -- in quick succession -- two 
pairs of jeans, T-shirts, and a pair of light overcoats.

How the ruddy --

RON

Undetectable Extension Charm.

HERMIONE

You’re amazing, you are.

RON

Always the tone of surprise.

As she gives the bag a shake, there is LOUD echoing of 
heavy objects, as if something has fallen.

That’ll be the books.

Shabby.  Greasy.  Empty.  The trio slide into a booth.

HARRY

Do you reckon everyone’s alright

RON

They were after you, mate.  We’d 
just put everyone in danger going 
back.

Ron’s right.  Cappuccino, please.

A gum-chewing WAITRESS stands behind Harry.  Ron, 
clueless when it comes to cappuccinos, nods to Hermione.

So where do we go from here?  The

HERMIONE

Too dangerous.  If Voldemort’s 
taken over the Ministry, none of 
the old places are safe.

The front door SQUEALS and TWO WORKMEN enter, glance idly 
at the trio and step to the counter.

HARRY

My rucksack.  With all my things.  
I left it back at the Burrow --

Hermione is shaking her head.  Harry eyes the beaded 
purse.

You’re joking.

HARRY

HERMIONE

I’ve had the essentials packed for 
days.  Just in case.

RON

By the way -- these jeans?  Not my 
favorite.  Bit tight.

Hermione gives him a withering glance.  Harry can’t help 
but smile.  Then his eyes shift to the SMALL SECURITY 
MIRROR near the ceiling, see the two workmen turning.

DOWN!

HARRY

The tile EXPLODES on the wall where Ron’s head had been 
only seconds before.  A rope of green light singes 
Hermione’s hair.

Stupefy!

HARRY

The JET of RED LIGHT hits the biggest Death Eater 
straight in the face and he crumples instantly.

Expulsio!

The table behind Harry explodes and the spell ricochets, 
shattering the security mirror -- sending shards raining 
everywhere, including one that laces Hermione’s cheek -- 
then striking the cappuccino machine, which sprays hot 
liquid all over the Death Eater.  He BELLOWS in pain and 
Hermione and Ron hit him with TWIN STUNNING SPELLS.  As 
he spasms on the ground, Hermione adds another for good 
measure:

Petrificus Totalus!

HERMIONE

He goes still.  The Waitress steps from the backroom.  
Sees the trio.  The wands.  Her gum bubble... POPS.

Go.

She doesn’t argue.

HERMIONE

Lock the door, get the lights.

HARRY

Hermione throws the bolt.  Ron clicks the Deluminator, 
pitching the cafe into shadow.  Harry eyes the 
unconscious Death Eater.

HARRY

This one’s name is Rowle.  He was 
on the Astronomy Tower the night 
Snape killed Dumbledore.

RON

This is Dolohov.  I recognize him 
from the wanted posters.

Ron rolls him over with his foot.  Dolohov’s eyes shift 
in fear from Harry to Hermione, then back to Ron.

RON

So what do we do with you, huh?  
Kill us if it was turned round, 
wouldn’t you?

Ron’s face is hard.  Hermione eyes him uneasily.  He 
notices.

RON

Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye.  
How would you feel then?

Hermione looks at Dolohov.  The moment hangs, then:

Hermione stops.  Harry and Ron turn, look back.

HARRY

Just then a great RUSH OF COLD AIR sweeps through the 
hallway and the trio’s tongues curl back in their mouths.  
Some THING shifts in the shadows at the end of the hall, 
rising from the carpet -- tall, dust-colored and terrible-
looking -- then rushes toward them.  It’s Dumbledore, but 
a ghostly, worm-eaten Dumbledore, a corpse come to life, 
with empty eye sockets and sunken face.  It raises its 
wand and then... EXPLODES in a great cloud of dust, 
swirling like mist in the corridor, drifting back to the 
carpet.

What was that about?

Homenum revelio.

a wall is the SYMBOL Xenophilius Lovegood wore around his 
neck, but the POV LINGERS upon it only briefly.  A SIGN 
comes INTO VIEW, hanging outside a small shop at the very 
end of a dark cul de sac:  “GREGOROVITCH, WANDMAKER.”  We

Harry’s wand BLOOMS in the darkness as he scales the

The drawers have been turned out.  The bedsheets 
stripped.  He moves on, painting the wall with wandlight, 
illuminating an EMPTY PORTRAIT of a MUDDY LANDSCAPE.  He 
studies it -- long enough that we’ll remember it -- then 
a FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS -- like the night before.  Harry 
wheels, points his wand down the dark corridor adjacent.

We watch Harry enter from an UNSETTLINGLY LOW POV

ransacked.  Harry lingers by a PHOTOGRAPH.  In it, FOUR 
YOUNG HOGWARTS STUDENTS -- JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, 
PETER PETTIGREW and Lupin -- stand GRINNING before the 
WHOMPING WILLOW.  Harry traces the thin cone of light of 
his wand across their faces.

Books and papers carpet the floor.  A WOMAN’S FACE, 
striking and wise, peers out from a dust jacket.  Harry 
crouches, turns the book over to read its TITLE:  A 
History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot.  Harry turns it 
BACK over, studies the woman's face again.  He begins to 
rise when he notices a CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER embossed 
at the top with a name:  Lily Potter.  As Harry begins to 
read, we hear HER VOICE:

Dear Sirius.  Thank you for 
Harry’s birthday present.  You’d 
think he’d been born on a broom.

Yes.  It was here, in this house.  
A most evil object...

How do you mean?

HARRY

KREACHER

Before he died, Master Regulus 
ordered Kreacher to destroy it.  
It was the last thing he asked of 
Kreacher.  But no matter how 
Kreacher tried, he could not..

HARRY

Where is it now?  Did someone take 
it, Kreacher?

KREACHER

(nodding)

He came in the night.  He took 
many things, including the locket.

Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?

HARRY

Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher.

KREACHER

The trio glance at one another, then Harry turns back to 
Kreacher, looks him in the eye.

Find him.

Ron fiddles with the RADIO, which WHISTLES EERILY as he 
attempts to find a signal.  Harry lies on his side, 
studying the Snitch in his palm, its wings flapping 
slowly.

They have flesh memories.

HERMIONE

Harry turns, sees that Hermione is eyeing the Snitch.

63

64

HERMIONE

Snitches.  They’re never touched 
by bare skin until the Seeker 
captures it.  Even the wizard who 
fabricates it wears gloves.  That 
way, if there’s a dispute, the 
Snitch can identify who first 
touched it.

You mean... it remembers me?

HARRY

HERMIONE

(nodding)

When Scrimgeour first gave it to 
you, I thought it might open at 
your touch -- that Dumbledore had 
hidden something in it.

Harry ponders this, eyeing the wings flapping slowly, 
then... Crack!  A SOUND ECHOES down the hall.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) (RAINING)

Harry and Hermione race into the kitchen.  CRAZY SHADOWS 
spill from a far door and POTS CRASH.  Suddenly, a TINY 
FIGURE, WET AND RAGGED, tumbles INTO VIEW, bangs into the 
wall opposite, and scrambles up.  As he starts back for 
the kitchen, he stops.  Sees Harry.  Smiles.  DOBBY.

Harry Potter!  So long it’s been --

DOBBY

Just then, a HAND -- Kreacher’s -- reaches out, grabs 
Dobby by the neck and pulls him away.

Mundungus’ wand soars into the air... into Hermione’s

KREACHER

As requested, Kreacher has

Dobby has also returned with the 
thief Mundungus Fletcher!

MUNDUNGUS

What are you playing at -- setting 
a pair of bleedin’ ‘ouse-elves on 
me!

DOBBY

Dobby was only trying to help!  
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon 
Alley, which Dobby thought was 
curious.  And then Dobby heard 
Kreacher mention Harry Potter’s 
name, which Dobby thought was very
curious.  And then Dobby saw that 
Kreacher was talking to the thief 
Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby 
thought was very, very --

MUNDUNGUS

You’re a thief, Dung.  Everyone

Mad-Eye fell off his broom --

Stop lying!

HERMIONE

Hermione begins to move toward Mundungus.  Ron reaches 
out, takes her by the shoulders, eyes Mundungus 
warningly.

RON

Piece of advice.  Let’s not rehash 
old times.  Got it... mate?

HARRY

When you turned this place over -- 
don’t deny it! -- you found a 
locket, am I right?

Why?  Was it valuable?

MUNDUNGUS

You’ve still got it.

HERMIONE

RON

No.  He’s worried he should have 
got more money for it.

MUNDUNGUS

Wouldn’t be difficult, would it?  
Bleedin’ gave it away, din’ I?  
There I was, pitching me wares in 
Diagon Alley when some ministry 
hag comes up and asks to see my 
license.  Says she’s of a mind to 
lock me up and would’ve, too, she

approaches.  Ron begins to walk, preceding her down the

The witch stiffens and falls... into the arms of Harry.  
Ron hurries back, takes her feet and...

between TWO WIZARDS, one tall, one short, both

THREE CUPS.

RON

Right. So let’s do it.  Who gets 
who?

HERMIONE

Well, unless one of you fancies 
wearing a skirt...

Hermione leans down, PLUCKS a HAIR from the witch.  Ron 
frowns as he surveys the two remaining wizards.

HERMIONE

Remember what we said.  Keep your 
eyes down.  Don’t speak to anyone 
unless absolutely necessary.  Act 
as normal as possible.  Just do 
what you see everyone else doing.  
We do that -- and with a bit of 
luck -- we get ourselves inside.  
And then...

It gets really tricky.

Morning, Reg!  Good luck today.

SKINNY WIZARD

Oh... yeah.  Thanks.

Ron glances to Harry and Hermione, jerks his head toward 
the skinny wizard and they follow.

As the skinny wizard drops down the stairs into a public 
toilet, the trio appear.

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

to his left, sees a PAIR OF BOOTED FEET climb into the 
next toilet, then looks to his right, sees Ron -- as Reg 
Cattermole -- peering in.

REG CATTERMOLE/RON 

Apparently so.

That’s bloody disgusting.

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

As Reg/Ron’s face disappears, Harry steps up onto his 
toilet, dips his shoe in gingerly, then withdraws it.  
Completely dry.  Stepping in fully, he reaches up, pulls 
the chain and is instantly sucked down.  Seconds later...

atrium of the Ministry of Magic.  He sees Hermione’s 
already arrived and standing before a MASSIVE STATUE of 
BLACK STONE depicting a witch and wizard sitting upon 
hundreds of naked bodies twisted in pain.  Harry joins 
her.

Are those...?

ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

MAFALDA HOPKIRK/HERMIONE

(nodding; with 
disgust)

Muggles.  In their rightful place.

Harry glances at the base of the statue, where the words 
MAGIC IS MIGHT are engraved.  Just then, a BALDING WIZARD 
bumps into Harry.

BALDING WIZARD

Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn!  
Forgive me...

The Balding Wizard hurries away, clearly frightened, as 
does ANOTHER WIZARD, merely at the sight of Harry.

You appear to be quite popular.

MAFALDA HOPKIRK/HERMIONE

Ron approaches, running a gauntlet of pitying looks from 
co-workers who echo the Skinny Wizard’s “Good Luck.”

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

I gotta tell you, I'm starting to 
freak out a bit.

Just then, a gang of YOUNG, ROUGH-LOOKING WIZARDS, led by 
their leader, SCABIOR, enter the Atrium, pushing along a 
small group of CAPTIVES.

ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY
The Ministry must be hiring young 
these days.

They’re not Ministry.  They’re

Two days now.

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

Really?  Have you tried an

Yaxley eyes Ron curiously, then leans forward menacingly.

YAXLEY

You do realize I'm on my way

Downstairs...?

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

YAXLEY

To interrogate your wife!  If my 
wife’s blood status were in doubt

Magical Law Enforcement needed a

UMBRIDGE

Ah, Mafalda!  Travers sent you, 
did he?  Good.  We’ll go straight

a QUILL floating in front of him.  Otherwise, it is 
eerily quiet.

Harry stops dead, peers around a corner and sees a 
slight, familiar-looking RED-HEADED WIZARD:  PERCY

Harry moves on.  Hears VOICES ahead.  Emerges into a wide 
open space and discovers dozens of witches and wizards 
sitting at a sea of small desks.  Waving their wands in 
unison, squares of PINK PAPER flit like kites through the 
air, dropping into neat stacks.  Harry creeps closer, 
sees that they are pamphlets entitled, “MUDBLOODS and the 
Dangers They Pose to a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society.”

RED-HAIRED WITCH

Reckon the old hag will be 
interrogating Mudbloods all day?

Sh...careful.

BESPECTACLED WIZARD

Pius Thicknesse appears, trailing a retinue of lackeys.

Runcorn.

THICKNESSE

Harry returns Thicknesse’s nod, watches him pass FROM 
VIEW.  As his gaze shifts, he finds the Red-Haired Witch 
regarding him with fear.  She looks quickly away, resumes
her work at double-time.  Harry’s eyes shift again, 
regard a SHINING MAHOGANY DOOR across the way.  He 
squints:  something is imbedded within the door.  He 
crosses the room, stops dead.  Fitted into the wood is an 
EYE.  It spins weakly, then stops:  Mad-Eye’s eye.  He 
looks down to the BRASS NAMEPLATE next to the door:

HEAD OF THE MUGGLE-BORN REGISTRATION COMMISSION

DOLORES UMBRIDGE

Harry’s jaw tightens in anger and he glances over his 
shoulder, sees the Red-Haired Witch watching him.  She 
glances away quickly.  Harry reaches into an inner pocket 
and removes a DECOY DETONATOR, an odd object with little 
weaving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body.  He 
releases it.

It scuttles down his body, across the floor and directly 
into the sea of desks.  Harry waits.  Then... Bang!  
Black smoke billows into the air, pink pages fly 
everywhere and the Detonator gives birth to dozens of 
tiny replicants of itself, which race about the floor, up 
the legs and across the desks of the pamphleteers.  The 
Red-Haired Witch SHRIEKS.  Others follow and Harry...

Nothing.  Harry frowns, glances about.  A LEAFLET bearing 
his face -- “Undesirable #1” -- lies upon Umbridge’s 
desk, along with PHOTOGRAPHS of other Order members.  Two 
have a LARGE PINK “X” scratched on them:  Dumbledore and 
Mad-Eye.

Harry begins to search the office, opening drawers, 
riffling through filing cabinets... then stops.  Pulls 
out a file.  Inside is a PHOTOGRAPH of Hermione and an 
accompanying DATA SHEET:  “Blood Status:  MUGGLE BORN”  
“Whereabouts:  Last seen in the company of Undesirable 
#1.”  Quickly Harry replaces the file and searches out 
Ron’s.  “Blood Status:  PURE BLOOD... Pro-Muggle
leanings.”  “Whereabouts:  Last seen in the company of 
Undesirable #1.”  Harry starts to put the file away, then 
pauses, looks closer.  “Father:  Arthur Weasley.  
Ministry Employee.  Status:  TRACKED.  Strong likelihood 
Undesirable #1 will contact.”  Harry stares at the word 
“TRACKED.”  Then:

BALDING WIZARD (O.S.)

All right, all right.  Let’s calm 
down, shall we?

Harry replaces the file, steps to the door and peers 
through.  Slowly, he eases open the door, back out and...

It probably just snuck up here 
from Experimental Charms.  I think 
none of us will soon forget last 
month’s Poisonous Duck...

Seeing the Red-Haired Witch’s expression, the Balding

soaking wet and wild-eyed.

The grilles open again and reveal... Arthur Weasley, in 
the company of an elderly witch (WAKINDA).

ARTHUR WEASLEY

I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t 
be a party to that.

Arthur stops then, seeing Harry, and regards him with 
utter disdain, then turns his eyes to Ron and softens.

ARTHUR WEASLEY

Hello, Reg.  Isn’t Mary in for 
questioning today?  Try to have 
faith.  If there’s anything Molly 
and I can do for you -- 

Arthur pats Ron’s shoulder, stops.  Pulls his dripping 
hand away.

tremble.

Bloody cold down here.

Then they see.  Swirling outside the courtroom doors like 
sentinels are tall black-hooded figures.  DEMENTORS.  
Just then, a man comes stumbling out of the courtroom in 
the company of a PAIR of DEATH EATERS.

SCARED MAN

I’m half-blood, I tell you!  My 
father was a wizard!  Look him up!

A dark cathedral, possessed of a palpable chill.  
Dementors float eerily in the gloom.  The ceiling 
stretches high, disappears in darkness.  As Harry and Ron 
enter -- unnoticed at first -- they move cautiously, 
taking in their surroundings.  Hermione comes INTO VIEW, 
sitting with a STACK of PARCHMENT behind a balustrade 
alongside Umbridge and Yaxley, while a BRIGHT-SILVER CAT  
-- Umbridge’s Patronus -- prowls up and down, providing 
warmth to them and them only.  Harry’s eyes track the 
cat, then drift to Umbridge herself. Suddenly he 
falters.  Ron notices.  Eyes him curiously.  WHISPERS:

What is it?

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

The corners of Harry’s eyes contract, his head slightly 
cocked... as if he can sense the presence of something.

It’s here...

Ron turns.  Below the balustrade, a frail woman, MARY 
CATTERMOLE, sits alone, wrists chained.  Seeing Ron, her 
wan face brightens.  Ron glances at Harry, who nods, 
urging him on.  Ron moves to the center of the room, 
taking his place behind the woman.  Hesitating, he places 
his hands gently upon her shoulders, then glances up, 
sees Hermione watching him.

Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

UMBRIDGE

Yes.

MARY CATTERMOLE

UMBRIDGE

Mother to Maisie, Ellie and 
Alfred?  Wife to Reginald?

Mary looks up to Ron, her eyes glistening with fear.  He 
smiles reassuringly.  She looks away, replies:

Yes.

Harry eyes Umbridge.  She has draped the pink scarf over 
her chair, revealing a GOLD CHAIN that extends from her 
neck down into the ruffled folds of her blouse.

A slight HUMMING, faint and oddly lyrical, rings in 
Harry’s ears as he studies the chain.  As if drawn 
forward by some irresistible force, he begins to drift 
toward the balustrade.

UMBRIDGE

A wand was taken from you upon 
your arrival at the Ministry 
today, Mrs. Cattermole.  Is this 
that wand?

Umbridge displays a CHERRYWOOD WAND.  Mary Cattermole 
nods.

UMBRIDGE

Would you please tell the court 
from which witch or wizard you 
took this wand.

MARY CATTERMOLE

But I didn’t take it.  I got it in 
Diagon Alley, at Ollivander’s, 
when I was eleven.  It chose me.

Umbridge leans forward, teeth glittering as the cat 
slinks by and briefly illuminates her face -- and the 
chain at her neck trembles like a snake, something heavy 
swinging forward and dangling over the void.  

The LOCKET.

Ron stares at it dumbstruck.  Hermione catches her 
breath.  Harry, fully removed from the shadow now, stands 
clearly in view, the corners of his eyes narrowing once 
again, the HUM growing louder in his ears.  Slowly, he 
reaches into his pocket...

UMBRIDGE

No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs. 
Cattermole.  Wands only choose 
witches.  And you are not a witch.

MARY CATTERMOLE

But I am!  Tell them, Reg!  Tell 
them what I am!

Ron starts to speak, but Umbridge’s gaze has shifted, to 
Harry, to the wand rising in his hand.. and pointed at 
her.

UMBRIDGE

What the devil are you doing, 
Albert?

As Harry speaks, his own face ripples through Runcorn’s, 
the Polyjuice Potion wearing off.

ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

You’re lying.  And one mustn’t 
tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!

A flash of red light hits Umbridge and she slumps, 
forehead striking the balustrade.  Instantly the silver 
cat vanishes.  Yaxley draws his wand, but Ron is too 
quick and takes him out with a single blast.  Hermione 
strips the locket from Umbridge’s neck and leaps down.  
Instantly, her breath comes in plumes as the Dementors 
drift forward.

EXPETO PATRONUM!

ALBERT RUNCORN/HARRY

A SILVER STAG soars from the tip of Harry’s wand, 
circling the room as it drives the Dementors back.

As the trio, along with Mary Cattermole, pelts into the 
atrium and races toward the fireplaces, Harry bumps into 
the muttering wizard, who spins, takes a look at Harry, 
blinks.

MUTTERING WIZARD

Harry Potter...?

(louder)
Harry Potter.

Another wizard hears, looks, then repeats the same, 
Harry’s name spreading like wildfire in the gloomy hush.  
Hermione glances about nervously and as she does, begins 
to transform back into herself.

HERMIONE

Harry... they’ve seen you.  We’ve 
got to get out of here.

Harry nods, quickens his pace.  Ron glances about, then 
turns, facing Mary as he continues to walk backwards.

REG CATTERMOLE/RON
Mary.  Go home.  Get the kids.  
I’ll... I’ll meet you there.  We 
have to get out the country, 
understand?

Mary shakes her head, confused.

Mary!  Do as I say!

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

Mary stops, a bit teary-eyed, nods dutifully.  Ron 
frowns.

I’m sorry.  It’s just --

REG CATTERMOLE/RON

Mary Cattermole takes him by the collar, pulls him into a 
deep kiss.  Harry and Hermione glance back and watch as 
Ron transforms -- during the kiss -- back into himself.

REG CATTERMOLE

All eyes turn.  The real Reg Cattermole stands -- 
robeless -- outside one of the fireplaces.  She looks up 
at Ron, now transformed, and jumps back.

Long story.  Nice meeting you.

RON

He gives her a peck, races off.  He’s halfway to the 
fireplaces when he spies... Percy.  He slows, then stops 
altogether, and they stare, wordless, at one another.  
Finally, Percy begins to open his mouth --

Piss off.

RON

Yaxley staggers into the atrium.

YAXLEY
Seal the exits!  Now!

Harry, Ron and Hermione glance at each other, break for 
the fireplaces.  As Yaxley fires on them, one fireplace 
after another seals itself.  As they reach the last open 
grate, they pitch themselves -- as one -- onto the 
polished marble floor -- spells sailing over their heads 
-- and go sliding inside.  As they fall into darkness, 
Harry glances back and watches Yaxley pitch himself into 
the void just before a solid block of granite drops -- 
like a guillotine -- sealing the fireplace and plunging 
Yaxley -- and the trio -- into total darkness.

A whirlwind tosses the trio as FLASHES of LIGHT reveal 
each briefly, including Yaxley, who reaches out for 
Hermione’s robe.  The door of Grimmauld Place rushes 
forward, the eyes of the SERPENT KNOCKER flashing, then 
there is a BURST of PURPLE LIGHT, a TORTURED SCREAM 
and...

The world spins as Harry lies on his back on a bed of 
leaves and twigs.  Above, sunlight streams through a 
canopy of trees.  Wincing, Harry rises on his elbows, 
sees the locket lying in the dirt.  He scrabbles up, 
scoops it into his fingers and GRINS.

HERMIONE

Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s 
a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of 
Dittany.’

in, objects present themselves in furious succession.

Accio Dittany.

HARRY

A small BROWN BOTTLE lands in his palm.

Unstopper it.

HERMIONE

Hermione rips open Ron’s shirt, which is soaked in blood.  
The flesh of his upper arm is flayed, as if someone had 
scooped a portion away.

Hermione.  His arm --

HARRY

Just do it!

HERMIONE

Harry does so, hands her the bottle.  She sprinkles three 
drops onto Ron’s BLEEDING WOUND.  Greenish SMOKE billows.

HARRY

What happened?  I thought we were 
going back to Grimmauld Place.

HERMIONE

We were.  We were there.  But 
Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we 
couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so 
when he let go I brought us here.  
Ron got Splinched.  I’m... sorry.

Don’t be stupid.

HARRY

The smoke sifts, clears.  Ron’s wound no longer bleeds.

It’s all I feel safe doing.

Hermione rises, takes out her wand and begins to walk in 
a wide circle, MUTTERING.

He’ll be alright in a few days.  
Hopefully.  If we could take him 
to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --

Harry’s glance stops her, confirming what she knows.

HERMIONE
So where do we go next?

HARRY

Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt 
that the Horcruxes would not be 
made out of random objects.  And 
he felt they wouldn’t be hidden 
randomly either.  We know of three 
so far.  The ring, which according 
to Dumbledore belonged to Tom 
Riddle’s grandfather.  The diary, 
which belonged to Tom himself. And 
this, which -- again, according to 
Dumbledore -- belonged to his 
mother.

Hermione eyes the locket as it glimmers in the firelight.

HERMIONE

It scares me a bit, that, thinking 
it’s a piece of Vol--

No, don’t!  Don’t say it!

RON

Harry and Hermione turn, see Ron stirring.

RON

It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name.  
That’s how they track people now.  
It’s how they found us in the cafe 
that night.

How d’you know?

HARRY

RON

I overheard a bloke from the 
Enforcement office talking about 
it at the Ministry.  Blimey,

Ron nods. Grimacing, he pushes himself up, notices he’s 
wearing a SLING of Hermione’s fashioning.  He looks from 
it to her as she tends the tea, a flicker of remorse 
playing over his face for his “dinner” remarks.

Is that it?

RON

Harry nods, hands him the locket.  Ron turns it over in 
his hand.  Frowns.  Looks at Harry, who nods.

HARRY

(off Hermione’s look)

I know.  I felt it too.
It’s... it’s like it’s ticking or 
something, like it has a tiny 
metal heart, like it’s --

Harry nods.  Hermione eyes it coldly.

I hate it.  It’s like he’s here 
with us.

That’s why we’re going to kill it.

HERMIONE

The ground beneath the stump craters, but the locket 
remains untouched.  Hermione lowers her wand, but Harry 
continues on, firing a succession of spells, looking 
almost possessed.  Hermione studies him oddly until, 
finally, he stops.  All goes silent except for the leaves 
shifting in wind above.  Then, slowly, another sound 
comes clear... a TICKING.  Coming from the locket.

It’s angry.

RON

Hermione shivers.  Harry steps forward, kneels down and 
takes the locket by its chain.  It TICKS.  He slings it 
over his neck.  Rises.

What’re you doing?

HERMIONE

HARRY

We have to keep it safe until we 
can figure out how to destroy it.

I can put it in my bag --

HERMIONE

No.

HARRY

RON

Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore 
sends you off to find a load of 
Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to 
tell you how to destroy them.  
Doesn’t that bother you?

Harry studies the locket, whose TICKING has slowed, then 
walks off.  Hermione eyes Ron, who returns her glance, 
then pushes away from the tree and walks off slowly in 
the opposite direction.

looks beautiful.  Seeing him, she smiles, waves, moves 
on.  The RADIO SPITS STATIC and he TILTS THE MIRROR so he 
can see Ron.  He looks annoyed, but holds his tongue and 
slips the mirror in his pocket.  Noticing the locket, he 
slips it from his shirt, studies the fissures in the 
locket’s metal skin.  Suddenly he WINCES.  The locket 
spills from his palm, dances upon the chain.  The SKIN 
encircling his scar CONSTRICTS.

Tell me, Gregorovitch.  Tell me

VOLDEMORT

You wouldn’t be lying to me, would 
you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I

Gregorovitch reacts with fear and we RUSH IN, DRIFTING

HARRY

Well it sets my teeth on edge.  
What’s he expecting to hear?  Good

Hermione moves deeper into the trees, then stops.  
SHADOWS splinter amid the towering trunks and VOICES come 
clearer.  Standing utterly still, Hermione watches as a 
GANG of SNATCHERS make their way in her direction.  They 
look unwashed and feral, as if they’ve been in the wild 
for some time.  As they pass, within feet of her, but 
unable to see her, only Hermione’s eyes track their 
passage.  As before Scabior leads the way, FENRIR 
GREYBACK at his side.  Abruptly, Scabior stops, eyes 
narrowing.

What’s that?  That... smell?

SCABIOR

The others glance about dumbly.  Scabior retraces his 
steps until he stands directly in front of Hermione, his 
eyes looking right through her.  He leans forward ever-so-
slightly, only inches from her neck, NOSTRILS FLARING.  
The locket TICKS, trembling upon Hermione’s breastbone.  
Then, slowly, Scabior pulls back, eyes probing the 
darkness, before withdrawing, leading the others away.  
The last pair drag what appear to be BODIES.

before that?  And the day before 
that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk.  
Sleep.

Harry stares at Ron, then begins to walk toward him.  
Hermione watches silently.  Ron stands utterly still.  
When Harry stops, he simply nods to Ron’s neck.

My turn.

HARRY

As he reaches out, Ron blocks his hand.  For a moment, 
they simply stand silently.  Then Ron strips the chain 
from his neck, hands it to Harry and brushes past him.
Harry glances at Hermione, drapes the Horcrux over his 
head and follows.  Hermione watches them go, then does 
the same.

EXT. ENCAMPMENT (COOLING TOWERS) - LATE AFTERNOON

107

A light RAIN falls.  Harry, wearing the locket now, walks 
the perimeter of the camp.  He glowers toward the tent in 
the distance.

In the tent, safe, warm and out of earshot, Hermione 
tends to Ron’s arm as he stares at Harry.

RON

He doesn’t know what he’s doing, 
does he?

A frown creases Hermione’s forehead as she studies Ron, 
then she glances at Harry, a trace of doubt in her eyes.

None of us do.

107A

107B

The charred husks of several RVs -- hulking black masses  
-- lay about the ash-ridden park.  Ron, trailed by Harry 
and Hermione, pauses.  His eyes scan the scorched earth, 
fix on a BLACKENED SWING, swaying back and forth in a 
tiny playground.  His eyes shift to the ground and he 
crouches.  His fingers shift the dry dirt, reveal a SHINY 
TOY not of Muggle making.

RON
Wizards were here.

I don’t like this place.

HERMIONE

Harry and Ron both turn, look at her.

I want to go.

HERMIONE

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

RON’S FACE FILLS THE SCREEN -- unwashed and wild.  He 
looks toward something UNSEEN.  Then...

... a RABBIT hops INTO VIEW, nose probing some brush.  
Slowly, Ron raises his wand, poised to fire when...

BAM!  Dirt explodes near the rabbit’s rump and it is off 
and running.  Seconds later, Harry appears, giving chase.  
Ron curses and pelts after.

The rabbit zig-zags through the trees, eluding one blast 
after another as Harry and Ron trip through the forest.  
They begin laughing, their aim becoming more and more 
erratic.  A tree limb explodes over Harry’s head and he 
wheels, fires playfully back at Ron.  They exchange a few 
more blasts when one narrowly misses Harry.  
Instinctively, eyes flaring, he wheels, fires back at 
Ron, narrowly missing him.

They both stop, stare at one another, chests heaving, 
their breath drifting in plumes, smiles gone.  Ron rubs 
his injured arm, almost healed now, and turns away.

In the shadows, Ron lies on his back, staring gloomily at 
the pitched ceiling of the tent, listening to the RADIO’S 
MURMUR, while Hermione, WEARING A RED SCARF AGAINST THE 
CHILL, runs the fingers of her left hand through Harry’s 
hair, alternately employing the wand in her right hand to 
trim Harry’s hair and flip the pages of A History of 
Magic.

Oh my god...

HERMIONE

HARRY

(alarmed)

What?

I’ll tell you in a minute.

HERMIONE

Harry watches his hair dropping to the ground.

Maybe you could tell me now.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor?  
It’s Goblin made.

Brilliant.

HARRY

HERMIONE

You don’t understand.  Dirt and 
rust have no effect on the blade.  
It only takes in that which makes 
it stronger.

O-kay.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Harry.  You already destroyed one 
Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle’s 
diary -- in the Chamber of 
Secrets.

HARRY

With a basilisk fang.  If you tell 
me you’ve got one of those in that 
bloody beaded bag of yours --

HERMIONE

Don’t you see!  In the Chamber of 
Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk 
with the Sword of Gryffindor.

HARRY

Exactly!  Which means...

HARRY

HERMIONE

Which is why Dumbledore left it to 
you in his will.

HARRY

You’re brilliant, Hermione.  
Truly.

HERMIONE

Actually, I’m highly logical, 
which allows me to look past the 
extraneous detail and perceive 
clearly that which others 
overlook.

There’s only one problem...

HARRY

Suddenly the LIGHTS CLICK OFF...

The sword was stolen.

RON

The lights click back ON.  Hermione and Harry turn, see 
Ron, Deluminator in hand, lying in the shadows of his 
bunk, staring at the roof as the FIRST DROPS OF RAIN hit 
the canvas above.

RON

Yeah, I’m still here.  But you two 
carry on.  Don’t let me spoil your 
fun.

Harry glances at Hermione, who is studying Ron warily.

HARRY
What’s the problem?

RON

Problem?  There’s no problem.  Not

Ron swings out of the bunk.  As his face meets the light,

find.

HERMIONE

Ron...

HARRY

I thought you knew what you signed 
up for.

Yeah, I thought I did too.

RON

HARRY

I don’t understand.  What part of 
this isn’t living up to your 
expectations?  Did you think we’d 
be staying in five-star hotels?  
Finding a Horcrux every other day?  
Did you think you’d be back to 
Mummy by Christmas?

RON

No, I just reckoned after all this 
time, we’d have actually achieved
something.  I reckoned you knew 
what you were doing.  I reckoned 
Dumbledore had told you something 
worthwhile! I reckoned you had a 
plan!

HARRY

I’ve told you everything 
Dumbledore told me! And in case 
you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a 
Horcrux!

RON

Yeah, and we’re about as near 
getting rid of it as we are to 
finding the rest of them, aren’t 
we!

Harry, we weren’t --

RON

Don’t lie!  You said it, too, you 
said you were disappointed --

HERMIONE

I didn’t!  Not like that!  Harry -- 
I didn’t!

RON

Do you know why I listen to that 
radio, every night?  Do you!  To

RON

NO!  YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S

Dead silence.  Harry glares at Ron.  Hermione looks 
shocked.  Suddenly, they both rush forward and lock on 
each other’s throats, Hermione rushes in.

Stop!  Stop!

HERMIONE

They let go, step back.  Harry points to Ron’s neck.

Go then.  But leave that.

HARRY

Hermione, eyes flashing with panic, glances from Harry to 
Ron.  Ron strips the chain from his neck, casts it away, 
then turns to Hermione.

HERMIONE

He whips aside the tent flap and the RAIN ROARS.  As 
Hermione rushes after him, she tips over the radio.  As 
it HISSES Harry glowers at the Horcrux.  Seconds later, 
Hermione returns, sopping hair plastered to her face.

He’s gone.

HERMIONE

EXT. RIVERBANK - MORNING

The river flows quietly, thick and muddy from the 
previous night’s rain.  Harry emerges from the tent, 
peers into the trees.  Hermione stands far down by the 
riverbank, tying the red scarf to a tree.

111

EXT. RIVERBANK - LATE MORNING

Hermione, eyes red from crying, clutches the beaded bag 
in one hand while the locket dangles from the other.  She 
peers one last time toward the trees, then, without 
turning, reaches out her hand.  Harry studies her, then 
steps forward, gently takes her fingers in his.  
Instantly...

... they Disapparate, pitched into a whirlwind of 
darkness.  As they reappear...

112

EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE MORNING

... on a windswept hillside, their hands break free and 
Hermione stumbles away, sobs racking her body as she 
buries her face in her hands.  Harry watches her, then 
turns away, takes out his wand and begins to walk in a 
circle, casting enchantments in a soft voice.

He shakes his head, vaguely annoyed, then starts to move

INT. TENT - DUSK (SECONDS LATER)

As Harry ducks into the tent, Hermione looks up.

HERMIONE
It’s a Muggle station.

Hermione smiles and Harry does too.  Harry listens then, 
debating, reaches out his hand.  Hermione eyes him 
uncertainly, then allows him to pull her to her feet.  He 
steps forward, gently removes the locket from her neck 
and tosses it to the ground.  She looks at it, then back 
to him.  He smiles and, without prompting...

... they begin to dance, tentatively at first, then 
letting themselves go.

Their shadows flicker upon the canvas like joyous shadow 
puppets, moving with abandon until, abruptly, the signal

moving.  Hermione averts her eyes, exits.  Harry watches 
her go, then takes the locket from the floor, slings it 
over his neck.

EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

Hermione, wrapped in a blanket, sits just outside the 
tent by a wind-whipped fire, going back and forth between 
Tales of Beedle the Bard and another book, Spellman’s 
Syllabary.

INT. TENT - SAME TIME - DAY

Harry lies on the top bunk above Ron’s empty lower, 
eyeing his face in the surface of the Snitch sitting

when an idea strikes.

Folding his fingers around the orb, he brings it to his 
lips briefly, then turns it over in his palm.

The Snitch’s tired wings go still.  Then, as if written 
by an invisible hand, WORDS appear on the smooth golden 
surface:

“I open at the close.”

Hermione.

HARRY

119

EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

119

Harry slips through the flap, hands her the Snitch.

HARRY

You were right.  It’s like you 
said.  Snitches have flesh 
memories.  But I didn’t catch my 
first Snitch with my hand.  I 
almost swallowed it.

Hermione watches the WORDS VANISH on orb.

HERMIONE
‘I open at the close?’

What do you reckon it means?

HARRY

HERMIONE

I don’t know.  But look, I’ve 
found something as well...

She turns The Tales of Beedle the Bard into the 
flickering light, points to the top of the title page, to 
a SMALL DRAWING of a TRIANGULAR EYE.

HERMIONE

I thought it was a picture of an 
eye, but now I don’t think it is.  
It isn’t a rune and it’s not in 
Spellman’s Syllabary either.  And 
it’s been inked in -- somebody 
drew it -- it isn’t part of the 
book.

HARRY

Luna’s dad was wearing that, at 
Ron-

At Bill and Fleur’s wedding.

What d’you mean -- wearing it?

HERMIONE

HARRY

Around his neck.  Like an amulet.  
I didn’t think much of it at the 
time.  You know Luna -- she’s 
always got some mad thing or the 
other she’s carrying around.  I 
just figured it ran in the family.

HERMIONE

Why would someone have drawn it in 
a children’s book?

As Hermione shakes her head, musing, Harry eyes her.

HARRY

Hermione, I’ve been thinking.  I -- 
I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.  
It’s where I was born, it’s where 
my parents died --

HERMIONE

And it’s exactly where You-Know-
Who will expect you to go.  
Because it means something to you.

HARRY

But it means something to him too, 
Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly 
died there.  Wouldn’t that be just 
the kind of place he’d hide a 
Horcrux?

Hermione eyes him.  Despite herself, she knows he’s 
right.

HERMIONE

It’s dangerous, Harry.  But I have 
to admit, recently even I’ve been 
thinking we might have to go.  I 
think it’s possible something else 
is hidden there.

(off Harry’s look)

The sword.  If Dumbledore didn’t 
want it falling into the 
Ministry’s hands, but wanted you 
to find it, what better place to 
hide it than the birthplace of the 
founder of Gryffindor himself?

knowingly)
Harry, did you ever even open A 
History of Magic?

HARRY

Tossed it at Neville once when he 
was snoring -- might’ve popped 
open.

She smiles, then rises, collecting her books and blanket.

Hermione...

HARRY

Words fail him.  Hermione reaches out, lightly strokes 
his hair as she heads toward the tent.

HERMIONE

Don’t ever let me give you a 
haircut again.

Golden streetlights glimmer along a narrow road leading 
to the center of town.  Christmas decorations twinkle in 
the windows of small cottages, roofs blanketed in snow.  
Hermione and Harry Apparate INTO VIEW, wearing HEAVY 
COATS and hats, scarves wrapped around their mouths.

HERMIONE

I still think we should’ve used 
Polyjuice Potion.

Harry pushes through a gate, then lets go of Hermione’s 
hand, row upon row of snowy tombstones stretch before 
him.  As he heads off, Hermione studies him, then 
follows.

Hermione pauses by a large tombstone freckled with 
lichen.

Harry.

Is it -- ?

No.  But look.

Harry steps over, looks:  KENDRA DUMBLEDORE AND HER

Hermione plays the wand’s light over the surface of the 
stone, then stops.  Though deeply worn by time, the 
symbol is unmistakable:  the TRIANGULAR EYE.  Hermione 
rakes the light over the name:  IGNOTUS PEVERELL.

HERMIONE
Ignotus... Hey, Har --

She stops.  Harry stands several rows away.  Utterly 
still.

NEW ANGLE - HARRY

As he stares at the tombstones of his parents:

JAMES POTTER

Died 31 October 1981

LILY POTTER
Born 30 January 1960
Died 31 October 1981

“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”

Hermione appears, looks at Harry.  Sees that tears are 
streaming down his cheeks.  Hermione raises her wand, 
traces a circle in the air and a WREATH of 

CHRISTMAS ROSES blossom in the snow.  Harry nods, staring 
at them.

Happy Christmas, Hermione.

Hermione laces her arm around his waist and he drapes his 
arm over her shoulder.  They stand silently.  Then:

gate.

Harry nods, careful not to look too soon, then glances 
up.  A STOOPED FIGURE, barely discernible in the drifting 
snow, stands in the shadows of the church.  She -- it is 
distinctly female, and older -- doesn’t move initially -- 
as if wanting Harry to see her -- then turns away.

C’mon.

HARRY

EXT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

All light has left the sky.  The stooped figure hobbles

windows and muffled voices can be heard.  Harry and 
Hermione follow.

Hermione eyes the woman ahead, then looks about their 
surroundings, feeling trapped.

I don’t think this is a good idea.

HERMIONE

We look like ordinary Muggles.

HARRY

HERMIONE

Muggles who’ve just been laying 
flowers on your parents’ grave.

Just then, up ahead, the stooped woman holds up her hand 
and Hermione and Harry stop.  Seconds later, a group of 
SNATCHERS passes by the alley.  As they vanish, the woman 
continues on.

Relax.  This is right.  I know it.

Hermione returns to him, looks.  GASPS.

Omigod.  Harry...

HERMIONE

HARRY

This is where they died, Hermione.  
This is where he murdered them.

Hermione studies Harry’s bitter profile, then the house, 
careful not to disturb the moment with words.  Absently, 
Harry places his fingers upon the locket at his chest.  
It is trembling -- over-so-slightly.  Then, without 
turning, while still staring at the house, Harry speaks:

You’re Bathilda, aren’t you?

HARRY

Hermione blinks, confused, then turns and jumps.  The old 
woman is standing only yards away, watching them.

INT. BATHILDA BAGSHOT’S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

The door rattles open and tiny BATHILDA BAGSHOT hobbles 
inside, followed first by Harry, then Hermione, who 
wrinkles her nose.  As Bathilda exits the room, Hermione 
glances about.

Harry, I’m not sure about this.

HERMIONE

HARRY

Hermione, she knew Dumbledore.  
She might have the sword.  
Besides, she’s barely knee-high to 
a house-elf.  I think we can 
overpower her if it turns ugly.

HERMIONE

There’s something odd about her.  
And what’s that smell?

She’s gaga, remember?

Bathilda returns, holding a box of matches.  She strikes 
one, tries to light a candle, but her movements are 
clumsy.

YOUNG GIRL (ARIANA), then runs a finger along a table.  
It comes away thick with dust.  She frowns, looks up, 
finds Bathilda watching her.

Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?

HARRY

Harry stands by a chest of drawers, holding the match 
over a grouping of PHOTOGRAPHS.  Coated in DUST, the 
figures in the frames flit like ghosts behind veils.  
Harry picks one up, wipes away the dust with his hand.  
In it a merry-faced boy looks out, his cheery expression 
belying a particularly intense gaze.

HARRY

His name.  Can you tell me his 
name?

Bathilda stares at the photograph solemnly, then peers up 
at Harry.  Her eyes are THICK with CATARACTS.  Harry 
stares, unnerved, then Hermione walks over, looks at the 
picture.

HARRY

This is him, Hermione.  The one I 
saw in Gregorovitch’s wandshop.  
The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is 
he?

She looks at him, then jerks her head toward the stairs.

She wants us to go upstairs.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Hermione hugs herself as she exits the sitting room and 
peers into the adjacent hallway.  A sliver of the kitchen 
can be seen and a faint BUZZING heard.  A strange SHADOW 
dances on one kitchen wall, of SPECKS moving.  Hermione 
approaches.

As Hermione nears the kitchen, she eyes the CLOUD of 
SPECKS swarming the wall curiously.  The BUZZING GROWS to 
a HISS as the room... comes INTO VIEW.  Hermione GASPS.

CLOTTED BLOOD streaks the sink and great wide swaths of 
RED stain the floor where HUNDREDS OF FLIES swarm.

BATHILDA BAGSHOT (O.S.)

I have something for you...

Hermione’s gaze rises, to the ceiling, to the HEATING 
VENT, from which the hissing voice has just come.

INT. BAGSHOT HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Harry’s arm droops, his wand tip painting the room with 
dots of light as he sways, wincing  as his scar stings.  
Bathilda points, to a dressing table cluttered with 
soiled laundry, her milky eyes fixed on Harry.  Something 
surfaces in her filmy corneas, her pupils changing from 
dots to silts.

Harry peers at the foul laundry, moving closer, when, out 
of the corner of his eye, Bathilda moves weirdly.  He 
wheels and watches in horror as...

Bathilda’s old body collapses and Nagini pours from her 
neck.  As Harry raises his wand, Nagini STRIKES, piercing 
his forearm.  His wand flies out of his hand, its light 
spinning dizzily around the room.  Nagini’s tail swings 
about, knocks Harry’s legs out from under him.

Harry!

HERMIONE (O.S.)

As Harry rolls onto his back, gasping for breath, 
Nagini’s massive body rolls over him, the Horcrux ticking 
feverishly against his chest. As Harry ROARS in pain, 
the lenses of his GLASSES fracture.

The bedroom door swings open, reveals Hermione 
silhouetted against the stairwell, wand poised.  A FLASH 
OF RED LIGHT ricochets around the room and Nagini’s tail 
whips angrily about, shattering the bedroom window.  
Hermione dives aside and Harry covers his face as the 
curtains burst into flames and shards of glass shower the 
room in a rush of cold air.

As Harry reclaims his wand and rises, Nagini’s body 
uncoils in fury, splintering furniture and blasting holes 
into the walls.

Confringo!

HERMIONE

As Hermione’s spell caroms off the trembling walls, we 
see both her and Harry reflected in a MIRROR.  He leaps, 
sweeping her toward the smoldering window.  As they pitch 
themselves into the night, the mirror EXPLODES and shards 
of glass, reflecting bits of Hermione and Harry and the 
giant snake, tumble in the night, slowly vanishing 
into... nothingness.

EXT. RIVER/WOODS (FOREST OF DEAN) - DAY

Weirdly quiet.  Like the memory of a day long ago.  A

woods, a pail of water in hand, leaving silent footprints 
in the FROST that glitters on the ground.

Hermione sits reading a BOOK by the fire.  The hillside

You’ve outdone yourself this time.

HARRY (O.S.)

Hermione turns, finds Harry standing outside the tent, 
admiring the view.  He looks pale, battle-worn.

HERMIONE

The Forest of Dean.  I came here 
once with my mum and dad, years 
ago.  It’s just how I remember it.  
The trees.  The river.  It’s like 
nothing’s changed.  Not true, of 
course.  Everything’s changed.  If 
I brought my parents here, they 
wouldn’t recognize any of it.  Not 
the trees.  Not the river.  Not... 
me.

Where are they?

HARRY

HERMIONE

Wendell and Monica Wilkens now 
reside happily in Sydney, 
Australia.  They have two dogs, 
run a small sweet shop, but floss 
daily.  No children.

She smiles, then it fades.

HERMIONE

Maybe we should just stay here, 
Harry.  Grow old.

Harry has no words.  She inhales, shakes off her tears.

HERMIONE

It was in Bathilda’s sitting room.  
Rita Skeeter had sent it to her.  
Harry, it doesn’t make for very 
nice reading --

HARRY

Who is he, Hermione?  The thief?  
Did Dumbledore know him?

Yes.

Well?

For a time.

HERMIONE

HARRY

HERMIONE

Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?

HARRY

HERMIONE

Gellert Grindelwald.  He’s not 
very well known in Britain, but 
there was a time, before You-Know-
Who...

HARRY

Hermione, I don’t need to have 
read A History of Magic to know 
who Gellert Grindelwald is.

Hermione nods, hands him the book, open to a PHOTOGRAPH 
of a TEENAGED DUMBLEDORE laughing with another BOY 
(GELLERT GRINDELWALD).  The caption:  “For the Greater 
Good?  Dark Days; Dumbledore and Grindelwald.”  On the 
opposite page is a PHOTOGRAPH of Grindelwald in later 
days, clad in black, holding a JAGGED WAND -- no longer 
the carefree lad of youth.

HERMIONE

When Grindelwald was seventeen, he 
was expelled from Durmstrang.  
He’d started doing some twisted 
things at school -- experiments.  
A few teachers had always 
protected him, but they couldn’t 
anymore.  After he left, he 
traveled for awhile, then ended up 
in Godric’s Hollow where his great 
aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.

Get to the hard part, Hermione.

HARRY

HERMIONE

She introduced him to Dumbledore.  
It made sense.  Dumbledore’s 
mother had just died, Grindelwald 
was troubled and they were both 
brilliant -- they’d never really 
had anyone they could talk to on 
the same level.  They did a lot of 
talking that summer.  But they 
always returned to one particular 
subject.

Harry looks up.

Wizard rule over Muggles.

HERMIONE

And Dumbledore believed in it?

HARRY

Yes.

HERMIONE

Harry nods, looking at the photograph again.

HARRY

‘For the Greater Good.’  What does 
that mean?

HERMIONE

It was something Dumbledore came 
up with.  He believed wizards were 
superior and should rule over 
Muggles, but gently, for their own 
good.  Grindelwald took a more 
violent position.

Harry shakes his head, staring at the book.

HERMIONE

It was a different time, Harry.  
It was one summer.  Dumbledore was 
young --

HARRY

We’re young, Hermione.  And here 
we are, risking our lives to fight 
against the very thing Dumbledore 
supported.

Harry stares at the photograph of the laughing thief one

HARRY

Where’s my wand?  I’ll take the 
watch.

Hermione hesitates.  Her expression makes him 
apprehensive.

Hermione.  Where’s my wand?

HARRY

She points.  There, lying by the fire, is a shattered 
stick.  He picks it up gently, sees that it is nearly 
severed in two.  One fragile strand of phoenix feather 
holds it together.

HERMIONE

It’s my fault.  As we were leaving 
Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse 
and it rebounded... I’m sorry, 
Harry, I tried to mend it but 
wands are different --

It’s done.

HARRY

Maybe we can --

HERMIONE

It’s done.

HARRY

His tone puts an end to it.  She nods.

HARRY

Leave me yours.  You get back in 
the warm.  And give me that.

Harry gestures to the locket.  Hermione starts to speak, 
then simply hands it over.  She starts to leave, pauses.

EXT. TENT (FOREST OF DEAN) - NIGHT (LATER)

The fire is merely embers.  Harry sits with a frost-
encrusted blanket draped over his shoulders, staring 
bitterly into the dark forest.  The silence is eerie, 
SHADOWS play in the trees.  He peers through the tent 
flap and sees Hermione slumbering in the light of a SMALL 
BOWL of FLAMES.  Then, slowly, LIGHT CRAWLS briefly over 
the tent canvas and he turns, peers into the forest once 
more.  Something seems to GLIMMER FAINTLY, but so briefly 
as to seem a trick of the eye.  The air is cold, gives 
texture to the darkness, makes it a living thing.

And then it is there again, the LIGHT -- pure and bright 
and silver and moving through the trees toward him.  
Harry rises and the blanket slithers off his shoulders.  
Gripping Hermione’s wand, he watches the LIGHT drift 
closer, then shatter throughout the trees, momentarily 
blinding.  And then it appears...

... a SILVER-WHITE DOE, moon-bright and dazzling.  It 
gazes at Harry and he stands, transfixed. And then the 
doe turns away.  His voice cracks:

No...

HARRY

141

EXT. FOREST OF DEAN - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

141

FROST CRUNCHES beneath Harry’s feet as he dashes through 
the trees in pursuit of the silent doe up ahead, breath 
streaming from his lungs.  She leads him deep into the 
forest until, finally, she stops, as does Harry.  As he 
watches, she turns her beautiful head toward him... and 
vanishes. For a moment, a GHOST IMAGE of her, like a 
retina burn, hangs in the air and then Harry is plunged 
into darkness.

Lumos!

HARRY

Hermione’s wand-tip ignites.  Harry paints the clearing 
with light and something GLEAMS:  a small FROZEN POOL.  
He crosses to it, looks down.  He sees his own image 
reflected dully and then, deeper, within, a SILVER CROSS.  
He looks closer.

It is the SWORD OF GRYFFINDOR.

Harry steps back, blinks.  It’s still there.  He glances 
about, painting the trees with light, looking to insure 
he is alone, then casts light upon the pool once more.

Accio Sword.

HARRY

Nothing.  Harry walks about the pool again and again and 
then stops.  He crouches...

... and looks slowly down at his chest.  The Horcrux 
around his neck has begun to TWITCH.  Harry places his 
fingers upon it briefly, then rises.  Quickly, with 
fumbling fingers, he SHEDS his clothes and points 
Hermione’s wand at the pool.

CHUNKS of DARK ICE rock the surface.  Harry steps to the 
pool’s edge, peers within... and PLUNGES...

INT. ICY POOL (FOREST OF DEAN) - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

... SCREAMING in the dark silence of the chill water.  He 
kicks down to the glimmering sword, grabs the hilt and 
kicks for the surface when...

... the locket’s chain begins to COIL, tightening like a 
SNAKE about his neck.  As the links bite into his throat, 
he releases the sword and begins to thrash about, 
struggling to get his fingers under the chain.  Realizing 
it’s no use...

... he reaches for the pool’s edge, his fingers 
scrabbling desperately over the ice, but unable to gain 
purchase.  Slowly, his hands go limp and slip from the 
ice back into...

... the water, where he drifts slowly down, a slow trail 
of bubbles escaping his mouth, eyes half-closed as he 
peers upward, watching as the surface of the water grows 
slowly calm... peaceful... when... a SHADOW appears 
and...

... a PAIR of HANDS shatter the glassy surface of the 
water and Harry is pulled upward and out, landing...

Harry’s eyes pop open.  Standing a few yards away, fully 
dressed and half-drenched, clutching the sword of --

clothes.

No.  I reckoned it was you.

RON

My Patronus is a stag.

HARRY

Right.  Antlers.

Ron brings his arms up, vaguely pantomiming antlers, but 
the effect is lost, what with the sword and locket.

You didn’t see anyone else?

HARRY

RON

No, I... I did think maybe I saw 
something -- when I was running -- 
over there -- 

Harry crosses to a pair of OAKS grown close together.

Anything?

RON

HARRY

(shaking his head)

But I reckon whoever cast the doe, 
put the sword in that pool hoping 
we’d find it.

And we did, didn’t we?

RON

The “we” hangs in the chill air.  Harry eyes Ron, then 
steps forward and dangles the locket close to the sword.  
It immediately begins to TWITCH.

See that?  It knows.  It’s afraid.

I’m not making excuses for how I 
acted, but that thing affects me 
more than it affects you and 
Hermione.  It made me think stuff 
-- stuff I was thinking anyway, 
but it made everything worse.

HARRY
All the more reason.

No.  I can’t -- 

RON

HARRY

Then why are you here?  Why did 
you come back?

Harry’s tone is hard, meant to wound.  This stops Ron.  
He steps back, grips the sword with both hands.  Harry 
nods.

HARRY

I’ll have to speak to it in order 
for it to open.  When it does, 
don’t hesitate.  I don’t know 
what’s in here, but it’ll put up a 
fight.  The bit of Riddle that was 
in his diary tried to kill me.

Ron nods and then Harry sweeps a layer of frost from a 
flat rock, lays the locket down.

HARRY

On three.  One.  Two.  Three.
Take me inside...

Click!  The twin doors of the locket SNAP open.  Behind 
each glass window a LIVING EYE blinks -- Tom Riddle’s 
eyes.

Ron raises his trembling hands, poises the sword.  Then a 
VOICE hisses from the Horcrux.

The locket QUIVERS in Harry’s fingers, turning WHITE-HOT, 
and he releases it.  As the eyes gleam SCARLET, Harry 
grimaces and a FLASH OF BLINDING LIGHT BURSTS forth, 
leaving in its wake two FIGURES floating in the darkness  
-- GHOST IMAGES of Harry and Hermione.

We were better without you, 
happier without you.

Who could look at you beside Harry 
Potter?  What are you, compared

Ron’s head turns then, to Harry, and Harry freezes.  A 
trace of SCARLET glints in Ron’s eyes.  He raises the 
sword high and -- for a moment -- Harry looks fearful.  
Then, Ron pivots and brings the blade down hard, cleaving 
the locket.  A SCREAM echoes throughout the forest and 
the ghostly Harry and Hermione turn to dust, becoming one 
with the vapor drifting from Ron’s mouth and all is...

Quiet.

Harry eyes the shattered locket, then turns his gaze on 
Ron who stands alone, sword dangling from the end of his 
arm, chest heaving.

Harry scoops up the locket and examines it.  Riddle’s 
eyes are gone, the silk lining stained and faintly 
smoking.  Ron lets the sword fall to the ground, drops to 
his knees.  Harry steps forward and -- carefully -- 
places a hand upon his shoulder.

HARRY

After you left, she cried for a 
week.  She’s like my sister.

I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I left.

He steps aside and Hermione sees Ron, standing at the

Knew what?

Just knew.  On account of 
Hermione’s voice.  And sure 
enough, it floated toward me, the 
ball of light, right to my chest

It was true.  Every word.

You’re going to think I’m mental,

I think he knew that at some point 
I’d... need to find my way back.  
And she’d lead me.

special, but I reckon it’ll do.  I

Nothing.

We need to talk.

Ron wheels, sees Hermione standing in the mouth of the

All right.

RON

HERMIONE

(ignoring him)

I want to go and see Xenophilius 
Lovegood.

Sorry?

HARRY

HERMIONE

See this?  It’s a letter 
Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.  
Look at the signature.  It’s the 
mark again.

Hermione turns the book in Harry’s direction.  Dumbledore 
replaced the “A” in Albus with the TRIANGULAR EYE.

HERMIONE

It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In 
Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard 
in Godric’s Hollow -- what?

They all look down at the symbol etched in Dumbledore’s

HERMIONE

Harry, you don’t have a clue where 
the next Horcrux is.  And neither 
do I.  But this, this means
something.  I’m sure of it.

I think Hermione’s right.  I think 
we ought to go and see Lovegood.

Ron’s hand flies into the air.  Harry eyes him knowingly.  
Hermione rolls her eyes, then lifts her hand as well.

Great tottering towers of Quibbler back-issues rise to

chugs away in the center of the room, spitting out new 
ones.

Excuse me.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD

As Lovegood steps to the wheezing press, the trio glance 
at past QUIBBLERS laying about:  MUGGLE MURDERS RISE, 
DOZENS DIE AS DEATH EATERS ATTACK, HARRY IN HIDING, WHERE 
IS THE CHOSEN ONE?  YOU-KNOW-WHO CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM:

Abruptly, the press goes silent and Lovegood turns.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD

So.  What brings you here, Mr. 
Potter?

Well, sir, we need some help.

HARRY

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the 
thing is, helping Harry Potter, 
rather dangerous these days...

The trio exchange glances.

RON

Aren’t you the one who keeps 
telling everyone it’s their first 
duty to help Harry?

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
I have expressed that view, yes.  
In the past.  Would you excuse me 
one moment.  I shall return 
shortly and, um, try to help 
you...

Lovegood dashes from the room.

What’s going on here?

HARRY

RON

He’s mental.  Let’s face it.

Lovegood reaches into his nightshirt and pulls out the

Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered,

Harry looks at the others, then Hermione reaches into her 
beaded bag and pulls out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.

It’s in here.

HERMIONE

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
Well, there’s no real reason to go 
on unless one is familiar with the 
tale.  Why don’t you read it 
aloud, Miss...?

HERMIONE

(opening the book)

Granger.  Well... all right.
There were once three brothers who 
were traveling along a lonely, 
winding road at twilight --

RON

Midnight.  Mum always said 
midnight.

(as Hermione glowers)

But twilight’s fine.  Better 
actually.

In time, the brothers reached a 
river too treacherous to pass...

HERMIONE

As Hermione continues, Lovegood looks out the window.  A 
CROW cycles INTO VIEW and we FOLLOW it, the sky 
DARKENING...

152

STORY - EXT. RIVER/BRIDGE - TWILIGHT

152

... as the crow swoops over a river to reveal THREE 
SILHOUETTES.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

But being learned in the magical 
arts, the three brothers simply 
waved their wands and made a 
bridge.  They were halfway across 
it when they found their path 
blocked by a hooded figure.

(CONTINUED)

152

HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY... - PT. 1 - Rev. 6/11/10

152

A BRIDGE MAGICALLY MATERIALIZES and the three figures 
begin to cross, when the HOODED FIGURE appears.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

It was Death and he felt cheated, 
for travelers usually drowned in 
the river.  But Death was cunning.  
He granted each brother a wish for 
their cleverness.  The oldest, who 
was a combative man, asked for a 
wand more powerful than any in 
existence.  So Death fashioned one 
from an elder tree on the banks of 
the river.

All of this is dramatized in surreal silhouette.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

The second brother, who was an 
arrogant man, asked for the power 
to recall others from Death.  So 
Death plucked a stone from the 
river.  Finally Death turned to 
the third brother.  A humble man, 
he asked for something that would 
make him disappear.  And so it was 
that Death handed over his own 
Cloak of Invisibility.  Death then 
stepped aside and the brothers 
went their separate ways...

We see the brothers cross the bridge, and part.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

The first brother traveled to a 
distant village where, with Elder 
Wand in hand, he killed a wizard 
with whom he had once quarreled.  
Proceeding to an Inn, he bragged 
of his invincibility.  But that 
very night...

We see a wizard, in shadow, slip into a room, KNIFE in 
hand.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

... another wizard crept upon him 
as he lay sleeping.  He took the 
Elder Wand... and slit the 
brother’s throat for good measure.  
And so Death took the first 
brother for his own...

We see the second brother approach a cottage.

HERMIONE (V.O.)
Meanwhile, the second brother 
journeyed to his home, where he 
took out the stone and turned it 
thrice in hand.  To his delight, 
the girl he had once hoped to 
marry before her untimely death 
appeared before him.  Yet soon she 
turned sad and cold, for she did 
not belong in the mortal world.  
Driven mad with hopeless longing, 
the second brother killed himself 
so as to join her.  And so Death 
took the second brother...

We see Death etched upon a bleak hillside.

HERMIONE (V.O.)

As for the third brother, Death 
searched for many years but was 
never able to find him.  Only when 
he had attained a great age did 
the youngest brother shed the 
Cloak of Invisibility and give it 
to his son.  He then greeted Death 
as an old friend and went with him 
gladly, departing this life as 
equals...

As Death and the third brother retreat, the crow returns, 
beating into the sky, which LIGHTENS, and we PULL BACK...

The Cloak of Invisibility.  
Together... they make the Deathly 
Hallows.  Together... they make 
one master of Death.

The trio stare at the symbol.

HERMIONE

Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell 
family have anything to do with 
the Deathly Hallows?

(to Harry and Ron)

That was the name on the grave 
with the mark on it in Godric’s 
Hollow.  Ignotus Peverell.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD

Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus
and Antioch are thought to be the 
original owners of the Hallows and 
therefore the inspiration for the 
story.

Lovegood’s focus abruptly wavers, sadness in his eyes, 
then he blinks, eyes the tea kettle.

XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD

Ah, but your tea’s grown cold.  
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

Let’s get out of here once he’s

Yeah, but imagine what a short

But I have one.  The Invisibility 
Cloak my father left me.

There have always been Cloaks -- 

HERMIONE

RON

Not like Harry’s.  I’ve seen a 
fair few.  Dad used to bring home 
the ones the Ministry confiscated

Quibblers everywhere, like a flock of doves, smoking with

Lovegood is blasted off his feet by a Stunning Spell so

settles at Harry’s feet.  Harry glances down, watches the 
symbol of the Deathly Hallows dissolve like mercury, then 
looks up, sees Lovegood streak out the door.

Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!

HERMIONE

Harry and Ron begin to crawl on their knees toward 
Hermione when another volley of spells ricochet about the 
room and -- ping! -- strike the Gurdyroot teapot.  As

are...

SNATCHERS.

A wand BLOOMS above, illuminates the face of Scabior.

Harry slashes through the river, looks up, and sees a 
Snatcher leap across the divide from one tree to another.

Ron pounds through thick brush, over a fallen tree.

The forest grows more dense, the shadows thicken.  Spells 
splinter through the trees, ropes of light lace the 
night.

Hermione stumbles, regains her footing, finds herself in
