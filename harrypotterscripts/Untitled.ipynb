For a\\nmoment, the trio stand in silence, as if words would\\nbring the bridge crashing down. Finally, Harry glances\\noff at the ruins of the castle, smoldering in the\\ndistance.\\nHARRY\\nWell, it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t boring, was it?\\nRon turns, ready with a reply, but whatever words were\\nthere -- briefly -- are gone before he can utter them.\\nThey all stare into the distance, giving themselves over\\nto the silence. Then -- tentatively, tenderly -- fingers\\nreach out -- Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s -- and brush Ron and Harryâ\\x80\\x99s.\\nThey look over. See that her eyes are closed, as if she\\nwere committing the moment to memory. They glance\\nbriefly at one another and then -- tentatively, tenderly\\n-- interlace their own fingers with Hermioneâ\\x80\\x99s, looking\\noff and -- like her -- closing their eyes.\\nGradually, the BIRDSONGS lilting in the BREEZE give way\\nto CAR HORNS...\\n367\\n\\nEXT.

PLATFORM - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)\\nCommuters stare curiously as the family weaves its way to\\na BARRIER between platforms nine and ten. As they come\\nto a halt, the parentsâ\\x80\\x99 faces come clear: Harry, now 36\\nyears old, and Ginny, now 35. Beside them are their\\nchildren: JAMES (12), ALBUS (11) and LILY -- the\\nyoungest.\\nJames, mischief in his eyes, looks back at his brother\\njust before he runs through the barrier.\\nAnd... VANISHES.\\nAlbus grips the handle of his trolley nervously, finding\\nit hard to follow.

Albus peers about anxiously.\\nThere is a riot of activity, as wizarding parents see off\\ntheir children and trunks are loaded. There are lots of\\nfirst years like ALBUS, looking equally nervous and being\\ngiven a final send-off. ALBUS looks at it all with\\ntrepidation. LILY races off chasing a paper bird that\\nflies through the crowd.\\nUp ahead ALBUS sees FOUR PEOPLE through the steam: Ron,\\nHermione and their two children, ROSE (11) and little\\nHUGO, as ROSEâ\\x80\\x99S luggage is packed onto the train -gentle goodbyes.
