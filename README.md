# QuoteGenerator

Text Generation - 
Using movie scripts, parse dialogues of some significant characters to create a "repository" of their dialogues and vernacular and create a quote generator, that, given a character would spit out some quote for the respective character

I'm looking at my all time favorite series - the Harry Potter movies to create an app that would create quotes for different significant characters, ex. Ron Weasley, Dumbledore, etc
